  abstract = {An important future goal in exoplanetology is to detect and characterize potentially habitable planets. Using nulling interferometry, LIFE will allow us to constrain the radius and effective temperature of (terrestrial) exoplanets, as well as provide unique information about their atmospheric structure and composition. We explore the potential of LIFE in characterizing emission spectra of Earth at various stages of its evolution. We perform Bayesian retrievals on simulated spectra of 8 different scenarios, which correspond to cloud-free and cloudy spectra of four different epochs of the evolution of the Earth. Assuming a distance of 10 pc and a Sun-like host star, we simulate observations obtained with LIFE using its simulator LIFEsim, considering all major astrophysical noise sources. With the nominal spectral resolution (R=50) and signal-to-noise ratio (assumed to be S/N=10 at 11.2 \$\textbackslash mu\$m), we can identify the main spectral features of all the analyzed scenarios (most notably CO\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_3\$, CH\$\_4\$). This allows us to distinguish between inhabited and lifeless scenarios. Results suggest that particularly O\$\_3\$ and CH\$\_4\$ yield an improved abundance estimate by doubling the S/N from 10 to 20. We conclude that the baseline requirements for R and S/N are sufficient for LIFE to detect O\$\_3\$ and CH\$\_4\$ in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet with an abundance of O\$\_2\$ of around 2\% in volume mixing ratio. This information is relevant in terms of the LIFE mission planning. We also conclude that cloud-free retrievals of cloudy planets can be used to characterize the atmospheric composition of terrestrial habitable planets, but not the thermal structure of the atmosphere. From the inter-model comparison performed, we deduce that differences in the opacity tables (caused by e.g. a different line wing treatment) may be an important source of systematic errors.},

  abstract = {In the general classical picture of pebble-based core growth, planetary cores grow by accretion of single pebble species. The growing planet may reach the so-called pebble isolation mass, at which it induces a pressure bump that blocks inward drifting pebbles exterior to its orbit, thereby stalling core growth by pebble accretion. In recent hydrodynamic simulations, pebble filtration by the pressure bump depends on several parameters including core mass, disc structure, turbulent viscosity and pebble size. We have investigated how accretion of multiple, instead of single, pebble species affects core growth rates, and how the dependence of pebble isolation mass on turbulent viscosity and pebble size sets the final core masses. We performed numerical simulations in a viscous one-dimensional disc, where maximal grain sizes were regulated by grain growth, fragmentation and drift limits. We confirm that core growth rates and final core masses are sensitive to three key parameters: the threshold velocity at which pebbles fragment on collision, the turbulent viscosity and the distribution of pebble species, which yield a diversity of planetary cores. With accretion of multiple pebble species, planetary cores can grow very fast, reaching over 30-40 ME in mass. Potential cores of cold gas giants were able to form from embryos initially implanted as far as 50 au. Our results suggest that accretion of multispecies pebbles could explain: the estimated 25-45 ME heavy element abundance inside Jupiter's core; the massive cores of extrasolar planets; the disc rings and gaps at wider orbits; and the early and rapid formation of planetary bodies.},

  abstract = {Highly eccentric orbits are one of the major surprises of exoplanets relative to the solar system and indicate rich and tumultuous dynamical histories. One system of particular interest is Kepler-1656, which hosts a sub-Jovian planet with an eccentricity of 0.8. Sufficiently eccentric orbits will shrink in the semimajor axis due to tidal dissipation of orbital energy during periastron passage. Here our goal was to assess whether Kepler-1656b is currently undergoing such high-eccentricity migration, and to further understand the system's origins and architecture. We confirm a second planet in the system with M c = 0.40 {$\pm$} 0.09 M jup and Pc = 1919 {$\pm$} 27 days. We simulated the dynamical evolution of planet b in the presence of planet c and find a variety of possible outcomes for the system, such as tidal migration and engulfment. The system is consistent with an in situ dynamical origin of planet b followed by subsequent eccentric Kozai-Lidov perturbations that excite Kepler-1656b's eccentricity gently, i.e., without initiating tidal migration. Thus, despite its high eccentricity, we find no evidence that planet b is or has migrated through the high-eccentricity channel. Finally, we predict the outer orbit to be mutually inclined in a nearly perpendicular configuration with respect to the inner planet orbit based on the outcomes of our simulations and make observable predictions for the inner planet's spin-orbit angle. Our methodology can be applied to other eccentric or tidally locked planets to constrain their origins, orbital configurations, and properties of a potential companion.},

  abstract = {Exoplanets observed by the Kepler telescope exhibit a bimodal, radius distribution, which is known as the radius gap. We explore an origin of the radius gap, focusing on multiplanet systems. Our simple theoretical argument predicts that type I planetary migration produces different configurations of protoplanets with different masses and such different configurations can result in two distinguishable populations of small-sized multiplanet systems. We then perform an observational analysis to verify this prediction. In the analysis, multiple Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are applied to the observed systems, using the statistical measures that are devised to systematically characterize the properties of multiplanet systems. We find with 99.5\% confidence that the observed, small-sized multiplanet systems are divided into two distinct populations. The distinction likely originates from different spatial distributions of protoplanets, which are determined by type I migration and subsequently trigger giant impact. We also show that these distinct populations are separated around the radius gap when the gas surface density of protoplanetary disks is \textasciitilde 102 g cm-2 in the vicinity of the host stars. This work therefore emphasizes the importance of planetary migration and the inner disk properties.},

In the present review, we discuss selected examples in these areas in a combined analysis of the state-of-the-art of synthetic methodologies and processes with their life cycle assessment. Thereby, we attempted to assess the potential to reduce the environmental footprint in these application fields relative to the current petrochemical value chain. This analysis and discussion differs significantly from a viewpoint on CO2 utilization as a measure for global CO2 mitigation. Whereas the latter focuses on reducing the end-of-pipe problem ``CO2 emissions'' from todays' industries, the approach taken here tries to identify opportunities by exploiting a novel feedstock that avoids the utilization of fossil resource in transition toward more sustainable future production. Thus, the motivation to develop CO2-based chemistry does not depend primarily on the absolute amount of CO2 emissions that can be remediated by a single technology. Rather, CO2-based chemistry is stimulated by the significance of the relative improvement in carbon balance and other critical factors defining the environmental impact of chemical production in all relevant sectors in accord with the principles of green chemistry.},

  abstract = {Context. The orbital distribution of exoplanets indicates an accumulation of super-Earth sized planets close to their host stars in compact systems. When an inward disc-driven migration scenario is assumed for their formation, these planets could have been stopped and might have been parked at an inner edge of the disc, or be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a resonant chain. This topic has not been properly and extensively studied. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the possibility that the inner planets in a resonant chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by outer planets. We performed hydrodynamical and N-body simulations of planetary systems embedded in their nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc was represented in two different ways, resembling either a dead zone inner edge (DZ) or a disc inner boundary (IB). The main difference lies in the steepness of the surface density profile. The innermost planet always has a mass of 10 M Earth , with additional outer planets of equal or higher mass. A steeper profile is able to stop a chain of planets more efficiently than a shallower profile. The final configurations in our DZ models are usually tighter than in their IB counterparts, and therefore more prone to instability. We derive analytical expressions for the stopping conditions based on power equilibrium, and show that the final eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For planets in thinner discs, we found, for the first time, clear signs for over-stable librations in the hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact systems. We also found that the popular N-body simulations may overestimate the number of planets in the disc inner cavity.},

  abstract = {Giant planets have been discovered at large separations from the central star. Moreover, a striking number of young circumstellar disks have gas and/or dust gaps at large orbital separations, potentially driven by embedded planetary objects. To form massive planets at large orbital separations through core accretion within disk lifetime, however, an early solid body to seed pebble and gas accretion is desirable. Young protoplanetary disks are likely self-gravitating, and these gravitoturbulent disks may efficiently concentrate solid material at the midplane driven by spiral waves. We run 3D local hydrodynamical simulations of gravitoturbulent disks with Lagrangian dust particles to determine whether particle and gas self-gravity can lead to the formation of dense solid bodies, seeding later planet formation. When self-gravity between dust particles is included, solids of size \$\textbackslash mathrm\{St\} = 0.1\$ to \$1\$ concentrate within the gravitoturbulent spiral features and collapse under their own self-gravity into dense clumps up to several \$M\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ in mass at wide orbits. Simulations with dust that drift most efficiently, \$\textbackslash mathrm\{St\}=1\$, form the most massive clouds of particles, while simulations with smaller dust particles, \$\textbackslash mathrm\{St\}=0.1\$, have clumps with masses an order of magnitude lower. When the effect of dust backreaction onto the gas is included, dust clumps become smaller by a factor of a few but more numerous. The existence of large solid bodies at an early stage of the disk can accelerate the planet formation process, particularly at wide orbital separations, and potentially explain planets distant from the central stars and young protoplanetary disks with substructures.},

  abstract = {The architecture of a planetary system can influence the habitability of a planet via orbital effects, particularly in the areas of stability and eccentricity. Some of these effects are readily apparent, particularly when they occur on short timescales that are easily numerically calculable. However, the appearance and evolution of life can take place on gigayear timescales, long enough that secular effects become important. These effects are difficult to investigate, as a direct integration requires significant computational time. In this paper, we apply a semi-analytic framework in conjunction with N-body integrations and predictive techniques to determine the relative habitability for an Earth-like planet in a system with two giant companions over a multidimensional parameter space. Relative habitability quantifies the integrated habitability probability compared to a system containing only a single Earth-like planet. We find trends with mass, eccentricity, location, spacing, inclination, and alignment of the giant planets, including configurations where the system is more habitable due to the giant planets. As long as the system remains stable, a moderate eccentricity excitation of the terrestrial planet can be beneficial by increasing the outer boundary of the habitable zone through higher mean irradiance. In our simulations, the median (\$\textbackslash pm 1 \textbackslash sigma\$) habitable planet has an eccentricity of 0.11 (+0.16, -0.08), though it started circular. Low-mass, widely separated, and moderately eccentric perturbing giants can accomplish this, an "ultra-habitable" configuration of companions.},

In most cases, the result is that extraction in amounts comparable to the present production from land mines would be impossible because of the very large amount of energy needed. This conclusion holds also for uranium as fuel for the present generation of nuclear fission plants. Nevertheless, in a few cases, mainly lithium, extraction from seawater could provide amounts of metals sufficient for closing the cycle of metal use in the economy, provided that an increased level of recycling can be attained.},

Here we analyze the planetary architecture of e Eridani via DYNAMITE, a method providing an integrative assessment of the system architecture (and possibly yet-undetected planets) by combining statistical, exoplanet-population level knowledge with incomplete but specific information available on the system. DYNAMITE predicts the most likely location of an additional planet in the system based on the Kepler population demographic information from more than 2000 planets. Additionally, we analyze the dynamical stability of e Eridani system via N-body simulations. Our DYNAMITE and dynamical stability analyses provide support for planet candidates g, c, and f, and also predict one additional planet candidate with an orbital period between 549 -- 733 days, in the habitable zone of the system. We find that planet candidate f, if it exists, would also lie in the habitable zone. Our dynamical stability analysis also shows that the e Eridani planetary eccentricities, as reported, do not allow for a stable system, suggesting that they are lower. We introduce a new statistical approach for estimating the equilibrium and surface temperatures of exoplanets, based on a prior on the planetary albedo distribution. e Eridani is a rich planetary system with a possibility of containing two potentially habitable planets, and its vicinity to our Solar System makes it an important target for future imaging studies and biosignature searches.},

  abstract = {New ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks allow us to probe planet formation in other planetary systems, giving us new constraints on planet formation processes. Meanwhile, studies of our own Solar System rely on constraints derived in a completely different way. However, it is still unclear what features the Solar System protoplanetary disk could have produced during its gas phase. By running 2D isothermal hydro-simulations used as inputs for a dust evolution model, we derive synthetic images at millimeter wavelengths using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the radial gas velocities of the disk. These velocity perturbations create traffic jams in the dust, producing over-densities different from the ones created by pressure traps and located away from the planets' positions in the disk. By deriving the images at \emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$} = 1.3 mm from these dust distributions, we show that very high resolution observations are needed to distinguish the most important features expected in the inner part ({$<$}15 AU) of the disk. The traffic jams, observable with a high resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and rings in disks and the number of embedded planets. We additionally show that a system capable of producing eccentric planets by scattering events that match the eccentricity distributions in observed exoplanets does not automatically produce bright outer rings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations of disks of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant planet formation scenarios during the disk phase, where the giants form either in the outer regions of the disks or in the inner regions. In the second scenario, the disks do not present planet-related features at large radii. Finally, we find that, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently, the dust masses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared to the dust contained in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick regions. Our study clearly shows that in addition to the constraints from exoplanets and the Solar System, ALMA has the power to constrain different stages of planet formation already during the first few million years, which corresponds to the gas disk phase.}},

  abstract = {In the effort to characterize the masses, radii, and atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets, there is an urgent need to find examples of such planets transiting nearby M dwarfs. The MEarth Project is an ongoing effort to do so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect exoplanets as small as 2 R{$\oplus$} transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in photometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability that is common among these stars and by the nocturnal cadence, atmospheric variations, and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound observatories. Here, we summarize the properties of MEarth data gathered so far, emphasizing the challenges they present for transit detection. We address these challenges with a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits in wiggly and irregularly spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods that clean trends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses the significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling variability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our Method for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability of a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian approach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters of this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters into its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual transits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates and compare our results to the popular box-fitting least-squares method with simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth Project, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing the false alarm probability of transit signals in real data.},

  abstract = {The MEarth Project is a ground-based photometric survey intended to find planets transiting the closest and smallest main-sequence stars. In its first four years, MEarth discovered one transiting exoplanet, the 2.7 R{$\oplus$} planet GJ1214b. Here, we answer an outstanding question: in light of the bounty of small planets transiting small stars uncovered by the Kepler mission, should MEarth have found more than just one planet so far? We estimate MEarth's ensemble sensitivity to exoplanets by performing end-to-end simulations of 1.25 \texttimes{} 106 observations of 988 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs, gathered by MEarth between 2008 October and 2012 June. For 2\textendash 4 R{$\oplus$} planets, we compare this sensitivity to results from Kepler and find that MEarth should have found planets at a rate of 0.05\textendash 0.36 planets yr-1 in its first four years. As part of this analysis, we provide new analytic fits to the Kepler early M dwarf planet occurrence distribution. When extrapolating between Kepler's early M dwarfs and MEarth's mid-to-late M dwarfs, we find that assuming the planet occurrence distribution stays fixed with respect to planetary equilibrium temperature provides a good match to our detection of a planet with GJ1214b's observed properties. For larger planets, we find that the warm (600\textendash 700 K), Neptune-sized (4 R{$\oplus$}) exoplanets that transit early M dwarfs like Gl436 and GJ3470 occur at a rate of {$<$}0.15 star-1 (at 95\% confidence) around MEarth's later M dwarf targets. We describe a strategy with which MEarth can increase its expected planet yield by 2.5 \texttimes{} without new telescopes by shifting its sensitivity toward the smaller and cooler exoplanets that Kepler has demonstrated to be abundant.},

While many evolutionary pathways are possible for inhabited worlds, a possible starting hypothesis is that most of them evolve similarly to Earth, which we propose could lead to a positive "age-oxygen correlation" between the ages of inhabited planets and the fraction which have oxygen-rich atmospheres. We demonstrate that next-generation space observatories currently under consideration could test this hypothesis, but only if the stellar age distribution of the target sample is carefully considered. We explore three possible parameterizations of the age-oxygen correlation, finding that they yield similar results. Finally, we examine how abiotic oxygen sources could affect the results, and discuss how measuring the age dependence of oxygen could shed light on whether it is a reliable biosignature. Future efforts can expand upon this groundwork by incorporating detailed models of the redox balance of terrestrial planets and its dependence on stellar and planetary properties.},

While in-depth observations of the nearest habitable worlds may yield enticing results, there are fundamental questions about planetary habitability and evolution which can only be answered through population-level studies of dozens to hundreds of terrestrial planets. To determine the requirements for next-generation observatories to address these questions, we have developed Bioverse. Bioverse combines existing knowledge of exoplanet statistics with a survey simulation and hypothesis testing framework to determine whether proposed space-based direct imaging and transit spectroscopy surveys will be capable of detecting various hypothetical statistical relationships between the properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Following a description of the code, we apply Bioverse to determine whether an ambitious direct imaging or transit survey would be able to determine the extent of the circumstellar habitable zone and study the evolution of Earth-like planets. Given recent evidence that Earth-sized habitable zone planets are likely much rarer than previously believed (Pascucci et al. 2019), we find that space missions with large search volumes will be necessary to study the population of terrestrial and habitable worlds. Moving forward, Bioverse provides a methodology for performing trade studies of future observatory concepts to maximize their ability to address population-level questions, including and beyond the specific examples explored here.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial planets are easier to detect around M dwarfs than other types of stars, making them promising for next-generation atmospheric characterization studies. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has greatly increased the number of known M-dwarf planets that we can use to perform population studies, allowing us to explore how the rocky planet occurrence rate varies with host radius, following in the footsteps of past work with Kepler data. In this paper, we use simulations to assess TESS's yield of small (0.5 R {$\oplus$} {$<$} R p {$<$} 2 R {$\oplus$}) planet candidates around nearby (d {$<$} 30 pc) M dwarfs. We highlight the underappreciated fact that, while TESS was indeed expected to find a large number of planets around M dwarfs overall, it was not expected to have a high planetary yield for the latest M dwarfs. Furthermore, we find that TESS has detected fewer planets around stars with R {$\star$} {$<$} 0.3 R {$\odot$} than even was expected (11 observed versus 24 {$\pm$} 5 expected). We find evidence that the photometric noise of stars in the TESS bandpass increases with decreasing radius for M dwarfs. However, this trend cannot explain the observed distribution of planets. Our main conclusions are (1) the planet occurrence rate likely does not increase, and may decrease for the latest M dwarfs; and (2) there are at least 17, and potentially three times that number, transiting planets around nearby late-M dwarfs that still will not be detected by the end of TESS's fourth year.},

We extract variability periods for 16\,880 stars from late-A through to mid-M spectral types and periods between {$\sim$}0.1 and 130\,d with no assumed variability model. We find variable signals associated with a number of astrophysical phenomena, including stellar rotation, pulsations, and multiple-star systems. The extracted variability periods are compared with stellar parameters taken from Gaia DR2, which allows us to identify distinct regions of variability in the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell Diagram. We explore a sample of rotational main-sequence objects in period-colour space, in which we observe a dearth of rotation periods between 15 and 25\,d. This `bi-modality' was previously only seen in space-based data. We demonstrate that stars in sub-samples above and below the period gap appear to arise from a stellar population not significantly contaminated by excess multiple systems. We also observe a small population of long-period variable M-dwarfs, which highlight a departure from the predictions made by rotational evolution models fitted to solar-type main-sequence objects. The NGTS data spans a period and spectral type range that links previous rotation studies such as those using data from Kepler, K2, and MEarth.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} One of the main scenarios of planet formation is the core accretion model where a massive core forms first and then accretes a gaseous envelope. This core forms by accreting solids, either planetesimals or pebbles. A key constraint in this model is that the accretion of gas must proceed before the dissipation of the gas disc. Classical planetesimal accretion scenarios predict that the time needed to form a giant planet's core is much longer than the time needed to dissipate the disc. This difficulty led to the development of another accretion scenario, in which cores grow by accretion of pebbles, which are much smaller and thus more easily accreted, leading to more rapid formation.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The aim of this paper is to compare our updated pebble-based planet formation model with observations, in particular the well-studied metallicity effect.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We adopt the disc model and the pebble model and use a population synthesis approach to compare the formed planets with observations.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that keeping the same parameters as in leads to no planet growth due to a computation mistake in the pebble flux (2018b). Indeed a large fraction of the heavy elements should be put into pebbles (\emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{peb{$<$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{tot{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.9) in order to form massive planets using this approach. The resulting mass functions show a huge amount of giants and a lack of Neptune-mass planets, which are abundant according to observations. To overcome this issue we include the computation of the internal structure for the planetary atmosphere in our model. This leads to the formation of Neptune-mass planets but no observable giants. Furthermore, reducing the opacity of the planetary envelope more closely matches observations.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We conclude that modelling the internal structure for the planetary atmosphere is necessary to reproduce observations.}}}}}}}}}},

We consistently re-fit all published radial velocity datasets for a sample of 65 stars and find 9 systems with statistically significant trends indicating the presence of an outer companion. We combine these radial velocity data with AO images in order to constrain the allowed masses and semi-major axes of these companions. We quantify our sensitivity to the presence of long period companions by fitting the sample with a power law distribution and find an estimated occurrence rate of 39+/-7\% for companions between 0.5-20 M\_Jup and 1-20 AU. Half of our systems were discovered by the transit method and the other half were discovered by the RV method. While differences in RV baselines and number of data points between the two samples lead to different sensitivities to distant companions, we find that the occurrence rates of gas giant companions in each sample is consistent at the 0.5sigma level. We compare the frequency of Jupiter analogs in these systems to the equivalent rate from field star surveys and find that Jupiter analogs are more common around stars hosting super-Earths. We conclude that the presence of outer gas giant planets does not suppress the formation of inner super-Earths, and that these two populations of planets instead appear to be correlated with each other. We also find that the stellar metallicities of systems with gas giant companions are significantly higher than those without companions, in good agreement with the well-established metallicity correlation from RV surveys of field stars.},

We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define {$\eta\oplus$} as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that {$\eta\oplus$} for the conservative HZ is between (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between and planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is {$\sim$}6 pc away and there are {$\sim$}4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

Integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of F0 = 0.77 planets per star, with an allowed range of 1.9. The allowed range takes into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of F0 beyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis.

This model includes planetary migration, \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}-body interactions between embryos, accretion of planetesimals and gas, and the long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous atmospheres.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most frequent around early M dwarfs (0.3 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}\textendash 0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) and that they are more rare for Solar-type stars and late M dwarfs. The planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass. The reason behind this is attributed to the emergence of giant planets for \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\star<$}sub/{$>$} {$\geq$} 0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, which leads to the ejection of smaller planets. Given a linear scaling of the disk mass with stellar mass, the formation of Earth-like planets is limited by the available amount of solids for ultra-late M dwarfs. For \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\star<$}sub/{$>$} {$\geq$} 0.3 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, however, there is sufficient mass in the majority of systems, leading to a similar amount of Exo-Earths going from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths and larger planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further identify a regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems such as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs, such as GJ 3512b, only form when type I migration is substantially reduced.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We are able to quantify the stellar mass dependence of multi-planet systems using global simulations of planet formation and evolution. The results fare well in comparison to current observational data and predict trends that can be tested with future observations.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are thought to be truncated at orbital periods of around 10 days. Therefore, origin of rocky short period planets with \$P \textbackslash textless 10\$ days is a puzzle. We propose that many of these planets may form through the Type-I migration of planets locked into a chain of mutual mean motion resonances. We ran N-body simulations of planetary embryos embedded in a protoplanetary disk. The embryos experienced gravitational scatterings, collisions, disk torques, and dampening of orbital eccentricity and inclination. We then modelled Kepler observations of these planets using a forward model of both the transit probability and the detection efficiency of the Kepler pipeline. We found that planets become locked into long chains of mean motion resonances that migrate in unison. When the chain reaches the edge of the disk, the inner planets are pushed past the edge due to the disk torques acting on the planets farther out in the chain. Our simulated systems successfully reproduce the observed period distribution of short period Kepler planets between 1 and 2 \$R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. However, we obtain fewer closely packed short period planets than in the Kepler sample. Our results provide valuable insight into the planet formation process, and suggests that resonance locks, migration, and dynamical instabilities play important roles the the formation and evolution of close-in small exoplanets.},

  abstract = {The NASA K2 mission, salvaged from the hardware failures of the Kepler telescope, has continued Kepler's planet-hunting success. It has revealed nearly 500 transiting planets around the ecliptic plane, many of which are the subject of further study, and over 1000 additional candidates. Here we present the results of an ongoing project to follow-up and statistically validate new K2 planets, in particular to identify promising new targets for further characterization. By analyzing the reconnaissance spectra, high-resolution imaging, centroid variations, and statistical likelihood of the signals of 91 candidates, we validate 60 new planets in 46 systems. These include: a number of planets amenable to transmission spectroscopy (K2-384 f, K2-387 b, K2-390 b, K2-403 b, and K2-398 c), emission spectroscopy (K2-371 b, K2-370 b, and K2-399 b), and both (K2-405 b and K2-406 b); several systems with planets in or close to mean motion resonances (K2-381, K2-398) including a compact, TRAPPIST-1-like system of five small planets orbiting a mid-M dwarf (K2-384); an ultra-short period sub-Saturn in the hot Saturn desert (K2-399 b); and a super-Earth orbiting a moderately bright (V=11.93), metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-0.579+/-0.080) host star (K2-408 b). In total we validate planets around 4 F stars, 26 G stars, 13 K stars, and 3 M dwarfs.

  abstract = {In recent years a paradigm shift has occurred in exoplanet science, wherein low-mass stars are increasingly viewed as a foundational pillar of the search for potentially habitable worlds in the solar neighborhood. However, the formation processes of this rapidly accumulating sample of planet systems are still poorly understood. Moreover, it is unclear whether tenuous primordial atmospheres around these Earth-analogs could have survived the intense epoch of heightened stellar activity that is typical for low-mass stars. We present new simulations of in-situ planet formation across the M-dwarf mass spectrum, and derive leftover debris populations of small bodies that might source delayed volatile delivery. We then follow the evolution of this debris with high-resolution models of real systems of habitable zone planets around low-mass stars such as TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Centauri and TOI-700. While debris in the radial vicinity of the habitable zone planets is removed rapidly, thus making delayed volatile delivery highly unlikely, we find that material ubiquitously scattered into an exo-asteroid belt region during the planet formation process represents a potentially lucrative reservoir of icy small bodies. Thus, the presence of external \textasciitilde Neptune-Saturn mass planets capable of dynamically perturbing these asteroids would be a sign that habitable zone worlds around low-mass stars might have avoided complete desiccation. However, we also find that such giant planets significantly limit the efficiency of asteroidal implantation during the planet formation process. In the coming decade, long-baseline radial velocity studies and Roman Space Telescope microlensing observations will undoubtedly further constrain this process.},

While it is still debated whether such a purposeful advertisement would be prudent and wise, we propose that mean-motion resonances between neighboring planets -- with orbital periods that form integer ratios -- could in principle be used to encode simple sequences that one would not expect to form in nature. In this Letter we build four multi-resonant planetary systems and test their long-term orbital stability. The four systems each contain 6 or 7 planets and consist of: (i) consecutive integers from 1 to 6; (ii) prime numbers from 2 to 11; (iii) the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 13; and (iv) the Lazy Caterer sequence from 1 to 16. We built each system using N-body simulations with artificial migration forces. We evaluated the stability of each system over the full 10 Gyr integration of the Sun's main sequence phase. We then tested the stability of these systems for an additional 10 Gyr, during and after post-main sequence evolution of the central stars (assumed to be Sun-like) to their final, white dwarf phase. The only system that was destabilized was the consecutive integer sequence (system i). The other three sequences therefore represent potential SETI beacons.},

  abstract = {Studies of close-in planets orbiting M dwarfs have suggested that the M-dwarf radius valley may be well explained by distinct formation timescales between enveloped terrestrials and rocky planets that form at late times in a gas-depleted environment. This scenario is at odds with the picture that close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is subsequently stripped away by some thermally driven mass-loss process. These two physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped transition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the compositions of planets within the M-dwarf radius valley may be able to establish the dominant physics. Here, we present the discovery of one such keystone planet: the ultra-short-period planet TOI-1634 b (P = 0.989 days, , R {$\oplus$}) orbiting a nearby M2 dwarf (K s = 8.7, R s = 0.450 R {$\odot$}, M s = 0.502 M {$\odot$}) and whose size and orbital period sit within the M-dwarf radius valley. We confirm the TESS-discovered planet candidate using extensive ground-based follow-up campaigns, including a set of 32 precise radial velocity measurements from HARPS-N. We measure a planetary mass of M {$\oplus$}, which makes TOI-1634 b inconsistent with an Earth-like composition at and thus requires either an extended gaseous envelope, a large volatile-rich layer, or a rocky composition that is not dominated by iron and silicates to explain its mass and radius. The discovery that the bulk composition of TOI-1634 b is inconsistent with that of Earth supports the gas-depleted formation mechanism to explain the emergence of the radius valley around M dwarfs with M {$\odot$}.},

In order to quantify the science potential of such a mission, in particular in the context of technical trade-offs, an instrument simulator is required. In addition, signal extraction algorithms are needed to verify that exoplanet properties (e.g., angular separation, spectral flux) contained in simulated exoplanet datasets can be accurately retrieved. We present LIFEsim, a software tool developed for simulating observations of exoplanetary systems with an MIR space-based nulling interferometer. It includes astrophysical noise sources (i.e., stellar leakage and thermal emission from local zodiacal and exo-zodiacal dust) and offers the flexibility to include instrumental noise terms in the future. LIFEsim provides an accessible way for predicting the expected SNR of future observations as a function of various key instrument and target parameters. The SNRs of the extracted spectra are photon-noise dominated, as expected from our current simulations. From single epoch observations in our mock survey of small (\$R {$<$} 1.5 R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{Earth\}\$) planets orbiting within the habitable zones of their stars, we find that typical uncertainties in the estimated effective temperature of the exoplanets are \$\textbackslash lesssim\$10\%, for the exoplanet radius \$\textbackslash lesssim\$20\%, and for the separation from the host star \$\textbackslash lesssim\$2\%. SNR values obtained in the signal extraction process deviate less than 10\% from purely photon-counting statistics based SNRs. (abridged)},

This loss of sea ice represents one of the most severe positive feedbacks in the climate system, as sunlight that would otherwise be reflected by sea ice is absorbed by open ocean. It is unlikely that CO2 levels and mean temperatures can be decreased in time to prevent this loss, so restoring sea ice artificially is an imperative. Here we investigate a means for enhancing Arctic sea ice production by using wind power during the Arctic winter to pump water to the surface, where it will freeze more rapidly. We show that where appropriate devices are employed, it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels, by about 1 m over the course of the winter. We examine the effects this has in the Arctic climate, concluding that deployment over 10\% of the Arctic, especially where ice survival is marginal, could more than reverse current trends of ice loss in the Arctic, using existing industrial capacity. We propose that winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps be considered and assessed as part of a multipronged strategy for restoring sea ice and arresting the strongest feedbacks in the climate system.},

Such differences in the observed bulk density of planets may occur as a function of radial location and time of planet formation. In this work, we show that the predicted differences are on the cusp of being detectable with current instrumentation. In fact, for HD 219134, the 10~per\,cent lower bulk density of planet b compared to planet c could be explained by enhancements in Ca-, Al-rich minerals. However, we also show that the 11~per\,cent uncertainties on the individual bulk densities are not sufficiently accurate to exclude the absence of a density difference as well as differences in volatile layers. Besides HD 219134 b, we demonstrate that 55 Cnc e and WASP-47 e are similar candidates of a new Super-Earth class that have no core and are rich in Ca and Al minerals that are among the first solids that condense from a cooling proto-planetary disc. Planets of this class have densities 10\textendash 20~per\,cent lower than Earth-like compositions and may have very different interior dynamics, outgassing histories, and magnetic fields compared to the majority of Super-Earths.},

Experimental petrology provides the fundamental properties of the ability of water and melt to mix. So far, these data have been largely neglected for exoplanet mass\textendash radius modeling. Here we present an advanced interior model for water-rich rocky exoplanets. The new model allows us to test the effects of rock melting and the redistribution of water between magma ocean and atmosphere on calculated planet radii. Models with and without rock melting and water partitioning lead to deviations in planet radius of up to 16\% for a fixed bulk composition and planet mass. This is within the current accuracy limits for individual systems and statistically testable on a population level. Unrecognized mantle melting and volatile redistribution in retrievals may thus underestimate the inferred planetary bulk water content by up to 1 order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of planet formation has been rapidly evolving in recent years. The classical planet formation theory, developed when the only known planetary system was our own Solar System, has been revised to account for the observed diversity of the exoplanetary systems. At the same time, the increasing observational capabilities of the young stars and their surrounding disks bring new constraints on the planet formation process. In this chapter, we summarize the new information derived from the exoplanets population and the circumstellar disks observations. We present the new developments in planet formation theory, from dust evolution to the growth of planetary cores by accretion of planetesimals, pebbles, and gas. We review the state-of-the-art models for the formation of diverse planetary systems, including the population synthesis approach which is necessary to compare theoretical model outcomes to the exoplanet population. We emphasize that the planet formation process may not be spatially uniform in the disk and there are preferential locations for the formation of planetesimals and planets. Outside of these locations, a significant fraction of solids is not growing past the pebble-sizes. The reservoir of pebbles plays an important role in the growth of planetary cores in the pebble accretion process. The timescale of the emergence of massive planetary cores is an important aspect of the present models and it is likely that the cores within one disk form at different times. In addition, there is growing evidence that the first planetary cores start forming early, during the circumstellar disk buildup process.},

  abstract = {Context.               The explosion of observational data on exoplanets gives many constraints on theoretical models of planet formation and evolution. Observational data probe very large areas of the parameter space and many different planet properties.                                         Aims.               Comparing theoretical models with observations allows one to take a key step forward towards understanding planetary systems. It however requires a model able to (i) predict all the necessary observable quantities (not only masses and orbits, but also radii, luminosities, magnitudes, or evaporation rates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary masses (from Mars mass to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits).                                         Methods.               We have developed a combined global end-to-end planetary formation and evolution model, the Generation III Bern model, based on the core accretion paradigm. This model solves as directly as possible the underlying differential equations for the structure and evolution of the gas disc, the dynamical state of the planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets yielding their planetesimal and gas accretion rates, disc-driven orbital migration, and the gravitational interaction of concurrently forming planets via a full               N               -body calculation. Importantly, the model also follows the long-term evolution of the planets on gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling and contraction, atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides.                                         Results.               To test the model, we compared it with classical scenarios of Solar System formation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain a giant impact phase of protoplanet-protoplanet collisions provided enough embryos (\textasciitilde 100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For the giant planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core shortly before the dispersal of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration that would bring them to the inner edge of the disc. Regarding the emergence of entire planetary systems, many aspects can be understood with the comparison of the timescales of growth and migration, the capture into resonances, and the consequences of large-scale dynamical instabilities caused by the gravitational interactions of protoplanets, including the situation when a second core starts runaway gas accretion.                                         Conclusions.               The Generation III Bern model provides one of the most comprehensive global end-to-end models of planetary system formation and evolution developed so far, linking a multitude of crucial physical processes self-consistently. The model can form planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that systems with only terrestrial planets are often well-ordered (in period, mass, and radius), while giant-planet bearing systems show no such similarity. In a series of papers, the model will be used to perform extensive planetary population syntheses, putting the current theoretical understanding of planet formation and evolution to the observational test.},

  abstract = {Context.               Planetary formation and evolution is a combination of multiple interlinked processes. Constraining the mechanisms observationally requires statistical comparison to a large diversity of planetary systems.                                         Aims.               We want to understand global observable consequences of different physical processes (accretion, migration, and interactions) and initial properties (like disc masses and metallicities) on the demographics of the planetary population. We also want to study the convergence of our scheme with respect to one initial condition, the initial number of planetary embryo in each disc.                                         Methods.               We selected distributions of initial conditions that are representative of known protoplanetary discs. Then, we used the Generation III Bern model to perform planetary population synthesis. We synthesise five populations with each a different initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last is our nominal population consisting of 1000 stars (systems) that was used for an extensive statistical analysis of planetary systems around 1               M               {$\odot$}               stars.                                         Results.               The properties of giant planets do not change much as long as there are at least ten embryos in each system. The study of giants can thus be done with simulations requiring less computational resources. For inner terrestrial planets, only the 100-embryos population is able to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each planetary system contains, on average, eight planets more massive than 1               M               {$\oplus$}               . The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital distances is 18\%, but only 1.6\% are at {$>$}10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such planets. The planetary mass function varies as               M               -2               between 5 and 50               M               {$\oplus$}               . Both at lower and higher masses, it follows approximately               M               -1               . The frequency of terrestrial and super-Earth planets peaks at a stellar [Fe/H] of -0.2 and 0.0, respectively, being limited at lower [Fe/H] by a lack of building blocks, and by (for them) detrimental growth of more massive dynamically active planets at higher [Fe/H]. The frequency of more massive planets (Neptunian, giants) increases monotonically with [Fe/H]. The fast migration of planets in the 5\textendash 50               M               {$\oplus$}               range is reduced by the presence of multiple lower-mass inner planets in the multi-embryos populations. To assess the impact of parameters and model assumptions, we also study two non-nominal populations: insitu formation without gas-driven migration, and a different initial planetesimal surface density.                                         Conclusions.               We present one of the most comprehensive simulations of (exo)planetary system formation and evolution to date. For observations, the syntheses provides a large data set to search for comparison synthetic planetary systems that show how these systems have come into existence. The systems, including their full formation and evolution tracks are available online. For theory, they provide the framework to observationally test the global statistical consequences of theoretical models for specific physical processes. This is an important ingredient towards the development of a standard model of planetary formation and evolution.},

(2013). These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using a generic mass\textendash radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating {$\sim$}96\% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.\textdegree 0\textendash 2.\textdegree 2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

Giant planets are more prevalent at orbital distances of 1\textendash 10 au compared to orbits interior or exterior of this range. The increase in planet occurrence at {$\sim$}1 au by a factor of {$\sim$}4 is highly statistically significant. A fall-off in giant planet occurrence at larger orbital distances is favored over models with flat or increasing occurrence. We measure giant planets per 100 stars with semimajor axes of 2\textendash 8 au and giant planets per 100 stars in the range 8\textendash 32 au, a decrease in occurrence with increasing orbital separation that is significant at the {$\sim$}2{$\sigma$} level. We find that the occurrence rate of sub-Jovian planets (0.1\textendash 1 Jupiter masses) is also enhanced for 1\textendash 10 au orbits. This suggests that lower-mass planets may share the formation or migration mechanisms that drive the increased prevalence near the water\textendash ice line for their Jovian counterparts.

  abstract = {The Gaia DR3 Catalogue contains for the first time about eight hundred thousand solutions with either orbital elements or trend parameters for astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and combinations of them. This paper aims to illustrate the huge potential of this large non-single star catalogue. Using the orbital solutions together with models of the binaries, a catalogue of tens of thousands of stellar masses, or lower limits, partly together with consistent flux ratios, has been built. Properties concerning the completeness of the binary catalogues are discussed, statistical features of the orbital elements are explained and a comparison with other catalogues is performed. Illustrative applications are proposed for binaries across the H-R diagram. The binarity is studied in the RGB/AGB and a search for genuine SB1 among long-period variables is performed. The discovery of new EL CVn systems illustrates the potential of combining variability and binarity catalogues. Potential compact object companions are presented, mainly white dwarf companions or double degenerates, but one candidate neutron star is also presented. Towards the bottom of the main sequence, the orbits of previously-suspected binary ultracool dwarfs are determined and new candidate binaries are discovered. The long awaited contribution of Gaia to the analysis of the substellar regime shows the brown dwarf desert around solar-type stars using true, rather than minimum, masses, and provides new important constraints on the occurrence rates of substellar companions to M dwarfs. Several dozen new exoplanets are proposed, including two with validated orbital solutions and one super-Jupiter orbiting a white dwarf, all being candidates requiring confirmation. Beside binarity, higher order multiple systems are also found.},

  abstract = {We put forward a model for accretion disks around T Tauri stars. The model assumes that angular momentum transport is driven by magnetic fields and can occur only in those parts of the disk that are sufficiently ionized that the gas can couple to the magnetic field. These regions lie at R {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.1 AU, where collisional ionization is effective, and at R {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.1 AU in a layer of thickness {$\asymp$} 100 g cm-2 at the surface of the disk where cosmic-ray ionization is effective. The model predicts that the stellar accretion rate is about 10-8 Msun yr-1, independent of the rate of infall onto the disk. Matter that is not accreted onto the star accumulates in the inner few AU of the disk at a rate of about 10-3 Msun in 104 yr. Given this buildup it is unlikely that accretion is steady. The effective temperature profile is Te {$\sim$} r-1/2 outside of 0.1 AU, which differs from the canonical Te {$\sim$} r-3/4. We calculate the expected spectral energy distribution for the disk and show that this temperature profile produces an infrared excess. Finally, we discuss some of the leading uncertainties in the theory.},

  abstract = {The search for signs of life on other worlds has largely focused on terrestrial planets. Recent work, however, argues that life could exist in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of carbon dioxide isotopologues as evidence of aerial life. Carbon isotopes are of particular interest as metabolic processes preferentially use the lighter \$\^\{12\}\$C over \$\^\{13\}\$C. In principle, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to spectrally resolve the \$\^\{12\}\$C and \$\^\{13\}\$C isotopologues of CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but not CO and CH\$\_\{4\}\$. We simulated observations of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues in the H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmospheres of our nearest (\${$<$} 40\$ pc), temperate (equilibrium temperature of 250-350 K) sub-Neptunes with M dwarf host stars. We find \$\^\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \$\^\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ distinguishable if the atmosphere is H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated with a few percentage points of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ for the most idealized target with an Earth-like composition of the two most abundant isotopologues, \$\^\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \$\^\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$. With a Neptune-like metallicity of 100\$\textbackslash times\$ solar and a C/O of 0.55, we are unable to distinguish between \$\^\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \$\^\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes. If atmospheric composition largely follows metallicity scaling, the concentration of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in a H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmosphere will be too low to distinguish CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues with JWST. In contrast, at higher metallicities, there will be more CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but the smaller atmospheric scale height makes the measurement impossible. Carbon dioxide isotopologues are unlikely to be useful biosignature gases for the JWST era. Instead, isotopologue measurements should be used to evaluate formation mechanisms of planets and exoplanetary systems.},

Proceeding from inside out, examining the connections between the deep interiors and the observable atmospheres, linking detailed measurements on giant planets in the solar system to the wealth of data on brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets, we aim to provide global constraints on interiors structure and composition for models of the formation of these planets. New developments after the Juno and Cassini missions point to both Jupiter and Saturn having strong compositional gradients and stable regions from the atmosphere to the deep interior. This is also the case of Uranus and Neptune, based on available, limited data on these planets. Giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs provide us with new opportunities to link atmospheric abundances to bulk, interior abundances \textbackslash rev\{and to link these abundances and isotopic ratios to formation scenarios. Analysing the wealth of data becoming available\} will require new models accounting for the complexity of the planetary interiors and atmospheres},

Being interested in possible application of the results to the formation of planetesimals in the vicinity of clumps and spiral arms in a circumstellar disk, we numerically integrate the equations of motion of such solids and study their migrations for different values of their sizes and masses and also for different physical properties of the gas, such as its density and temperature. We show that, considering the drag force of the gas, it is possible for solids, within a certain range of size and mass, to migrate rapidly (i.e., within \textasciitilde 1000 yr) toward the location of a local maximum density, where collisions and coagulation may result in an accelerated rate of planetesimal formation.},

  abstract = {The Juno mission has revolutionized and challenged our understanding of Jupiter. As Juno transitioned to its extended mission, we review the major findings of Jupiter's internal structure relevant to understanding Jupiter's formation and evolution. Results from Juno's investigation of Jupiter's interior structure imply that the planet has compositional gradients and is accordingly non-adiabatic, with a complex internal structure. These new results imply that current models of Jupiter's formation and evolution require a revision. In this paper, we discuss potential formation and evolution paths that can lead to an internal structure model consistent with Juno data, and the constraints they provide. We note that standard core accretion formation models, including the heavy-element enrichment during planetary growth is consistent with an interior that is inhomogeneous with composition gradients in its deep interior. However, such formation models typically predict that this region, which could be interpreted as a primordial dilute core, is confined to about 10\% of Jupiter's total mass. In contrast, structure models that fit Juno data imply that this region contains 30\% of the mass or more. One way to explain the origin of this extended region is by invoking a relatively long (about 2 Myrs) formation phase where the growing planet accretes gas and planetesimals delaying the runaway gas accretion. Alternatively, Jupiter's fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact or convection post-formation. These novel scenarios require somewhat special and specific conditions. Clarity on the plausibility of such conditions could come from future high-resolution observations of planet-forming regions around other stars, from the observed and modeled architectures of extrasolar systems with giant planets, and future Juno data obtained during its extended mission.},

  abstract = {In its long-duration observation phase, the PLATO satellite will observe two non-overlapping fields for a total of 4 yr. The exact duration of each pointing will be determined 2 yr before launch. Previous estimates of PLATO's yield of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones (HZs) around solar-type stars ranged between 6 and 280. We use the PLATO Solar-like Light curve Simulator (PSLS) to simulate light curves with transiting planets around bright (m\_V {$>$} 11) Sun-like stars at a cadence of 25 s, roughly representative of the {$>$}15,000 targets in PLATO's high-priority P1 sample (mostly F5-K7 dwarfs and sub-dwarfs). Our study includes light curves generated from synchronous observations of 6, 12, 18, and 24 of PLATO's 12 cm aperture cameras over both 2 yr and 3 yr of continuous observations. Automated detrending is done with the Wotan software and post-detrending transit detection is performed with the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm. We scale the true positive rates (TPRs) with the expected number of stars in the P1 sample and with modern estimates of the exoplanet occurrence rates and predict the detection of planets with 0.5 R\_E {$<$}= R\_p {$<$}= 1.5 R\_E in the HZs around F5-K7 dwarf stars. For the (2 yr + 2 yr) long-duration observation phase strategy we predict 11-34 detections, for the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy we predict 8-25 discoveries. Our study of the effects of stellar variability on shallow transits of Earth-like planets illustrates that our estimates of PLATO's planet yield, which we derive using a photometrically quiet star like the Sun, must be seen as upper limits. In conclusion, PLATO's detection of about a dozen Earth-sized planets in the HZs around solar-type stars will mean a major contribution to this yet poorly sampled part of the exoplanet parameter space with Earth-like planets.},

While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. As a result of vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most difficult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99\% and 94\% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending methods explored are available for public use in W\=otan, an open-source Python package on GitHub (https://github.com/hippke/wotan).},

Two main features stand out: (i) all planets have similar radii, masses, and compositions; and (ii) all planets are in resonance. Previous works have outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario where planets of similar composition form sequentially at the H2O snowline ({$\sim$}0.1 au for this low-mass star). It was hypothesized that the subsequent formation and migration led to the current resonant configuration. Here, we investigate whether the sequential planet formation model is indeed capable to produce the present-day resonant configuration, characterized by its two-body and three-body mean motion resonances structure. We carry out N-body simulations, accounting for type-I migration, stellar tidal damping, disc eccentricity-damping, and featuring a migration barrier located at the disc's inner edge. Due to the sequential migration, planets naturally form a chain of first-order resonances. But to explain the period ratios of the b/c/d-system, which are presently in higher order resonances, we find that planets b and c must have marched across the migration barrier, into the gas-free cavity, before the disc has dispersed. We investigate both an early and late cavity infall scenario and find that the early infall model best matches the constraints, as well as being more probable. After the dispersal of the gaseous disc, stellar tidal torque also contributes towards a modest separation of the inner system. We outline how the insights obtained in this work can be applied to aid the understanding of other compact resonant planet systems.},

We present new high-resolution spectroscopic observations with FEROS, CAFE, and HRS of approximately 500 M dwarfs. For each new observation, we determined its radial velocity and measured its H\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} activity index and its rotation velocity. Additionally, we have multiple observations of many stars to investigate if there are any radial velocity variations due to multiplicity. The results of our survey confirm that early-M dwarfs are H\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} inactive with low rotational velocities and that late-M dwarfs are H\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} active with very high rotational velocities. The results of this high-resolution analysis comprise the most extensive catalogue of rotation and activity in M dwarfs currently available.}}}},

  journal = {arXiv e-prints},
  abstract = {The pathway to forming the iron-rich planet Mercury remains mysterious. Mercury's core makes up 70\% of the planetary mass, which implies a significant enrichment of iron relative to silicates, while its mantle is strongly depleted in oxidized iron. The high core mass fraction is traditionally ascribed to evaporative loss of silicates, e.g. following a giant impact, but the high abundance of moderately volatile elements in the mantle of Mercury is inconsistent with reaching temperatures much above 1,000 K during its formation. Here we explore the nucleation of solid particles from a gas of solar composition that cools down in the hot inner regions of the protoplanetary disc. The high surface tension of iron causes iron particles to nucleate homogeneously (i.e., not on a more refractory substrate) under very high supersaturation. The low nucleation rates lead to depositional growth of large iron pebbles on a sparse population of nucleated iron nano-particles. Silicates in the form of iron-free MgSiO\$\_3\$ nucleate at similar temperatures but obtain smaller sizes due to the much higher number of nucleated particles. This results in a chemical separation of large iron particles from silicate particles with ten times lower Stokes numbers. We propose that such conditions lead to the formation of iron-rich planetesimals by the streaming instability. In this view, Mercury formed by accretion of iron-rich planetesimals with a sub-solar abundance of highly reduced silicate material. Our results imply that the iron-rich planets known to orbit the Sun and other stars are not required to have experienced mantle-stripping impacts. Instead their formation could be a direct consequence of temperature fluctuations in protoplanetary discs and chemical separation of distinct crystal species through the ensuing nucleation process.},

  abstract = {The relative rarity of giant planets around low-mass stars compared with solar-type stars is a key prediction from the core-accretion planet formation theory. In this paper we report on the discovery of four gas giant planets that transit low-mass late K and early M dwarfs. The planets HATS-74Ab (TOI 737b), HATS-75b (TOI 552b), HATS-76b (TOI 555b), and HATS-77b (TOI 730b) were all discovered from the HATSouth photometric survey and follow-up using TESS and other photometric facilities. We use the new ESPRESSO facility at the VLT to confirm systems and measure their masses. We find that these planets have masses of 1.46 {$\pm$} 0.14 MJ, 0.491 {$\pm$} 0.039 MJ, 2.629 {$\pm$} 0.089 MJ, and MJ, respectively, and radii of 1.032 {$\pm$} 0.021 RJ, 0.884 {$\pm$} 0.013 RJ, 1.079 {$\pm$} 0.031 RJ, and 1.165 {$\pm$} 0.021 RJ, respectively. The planets all orbit close to their host stars with orbital periods ranging from 1.7319 days to 3.0876 days. With further work, we aim to test core-accretion theory by using these and further discoveries to quantify the occurrence rate of giant planets around low-mass host stars.},

The snow line distance changes weakly with stellar mass; thus, giant planets form over a wide range of spectral types. The probability that a given star has at least one gas giant increases linearly with stellar mass from 0.4 to 3 M{$\Sun$}. Stars more massive than 3 M{$\Sun$} evolve quickly to the main sequence, which pushes the snow line to 10-15 AU before protoplanets form and limits the range of disk masses that form giant planet cores. If the frequency of gas giants around solar mass stars is 6\%, we predict occurrence rates of 1\% for 0.4 M{$\Sun$} stars and 10\% for 1.5 M{$\Sun$} stars. This result is largely insensitive to our assumed model parameters. Finally, the movement of the snow line as stars {$\greaterequivlnt$}2.5 M{$\Sun$} move to the main sequence may allow the ocean planets suggested by L\'eger et al. to form without migration.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Planetary migration is a key link between planet formation models and observed exoplanet statistics. So far, the theory of planetary migration has focused on the interaction of one or more planets with an inviscid or viscously evolving gaseous disk. Turbulent viscosity is thought to be the main driver of the secular evolution of the disk, and it is known to affect the migration process for intermediate- to high-mass planets. Recently, however, the topic of wind-driven accretion has experienced a renaissance because evidence is mounting that protoplanetary disks may be less turbulent than previously thought, and 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic modeling of the wind-launching process is maturing.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We investigate how wind-driven accretion may affect planetary migration. We aim for a qualitative exploration of the main effects and not for a quantitative prediction.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We performed 2D hydrodynamic planet-disk interaction simulations with the FARGO3D code in the (\emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{{$\phi<$}i/{$>$}) plane. The vertical coordinate in the disk and the launching of the wind are not treated explicitly. Instead, the torque caused by the wind onto the disk is treated using a simple two-parameter formula. The parameters are the wind mass-loss rate and the lever arm.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that the wind-driven accretion process replenishes the co-orbital region in a different way than the viscous accretion process. The former always injects mass from the outer edge of the co-orbital region, and always removes mass from the inner edge, while the latter injects or removes mass from the co-orbital region depending on the radial density gradients in the disk. As a consequence, the migration behavior can differ strongly, and can under certain conditions drive rapid type-III-like outward migration. We derive an analytic expression for the parameters under which this outward migration occurs.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} If wind-driven accretion plays a role in the secular evolution of protoplanetary disks, planetary migration studies have to include this process as well because it can strongly affect the resulting migration rate and migration direction.}}}}}}}},

By application of Bayes' theorem, we reverse this logic to show that the eccentricity distribution of transiting planets is positively biased. Adopting the flexible Beta distribution as the underlying prior for eccentricity, we derive the marginalized transit probability as well as the a priori joint probability distribution of eccentricity and argument of periastron, given that a planet is known to transit. These results allow us to demonstrate that most planet occurrence rate calculations using Kepler data have overestimated the prevalence of planets by~{$\sim$}10 per cent. Indeed, the true occurrence of planets from transit surveys is fundamentally intractable without a prior assumption for the eccentricity distribution. Further more, we show that previously extracted eccentricity distributions using Kepler data are positively biased. In cases where one wishes to impose an informative eccentricity prior, we provide a recursive algorithm to apply inverse transform sampling of our joint prior probability distribution. Computer code of this algorithm, ECCSAMPLES, is provided to enable the community to sample directly from the prior (availablehere).},

Anticorrelated TTVs are clearly evident indicating that the transiters orbit the same star and interact via a near 2:1 mean motion resonance.

TOI-216 lies close to the southern ecliptic pole and thus will be observed by TESS throughout the first year, providing an opportunity for continuous dynamical monitoring and considerable refinement of the dynamical masses presented here. TOI-216 closely resembles Kepler-9 in architecture, and we hypothesize that in such systems these Saturn analogues failed to fully open a gap and thus migrated far deeper into the system before becoming trapped into resonance, which would imply that future detections of new analogues may also have sub-Jupiter masses.},

  abstract = {Temperate terrestrial exoplanets are likely common objects, but their discovery and characterization is very challenging. Concepts for optimized space missions to overcome these challenges are being studied. The LIFE initiative focuses on the development of a space-based mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometer probing the thermal emission of a large sample of exoplanets. We derive first estimates for the signal-to-noise (S/N), spectral resolution (R), and wavelength requirements for LIFE. Using an Earth-twin exoplanet as reference case, we quantify how well planetary/atmospheric properties can be constrained from MIR spectra of different quality. We simulate LIFE observations of an Earth-twin orbiting a G2V star at 10 pc from the Sun with different levels of exozodiacal dust emissions. We combine a cloud-free 1D radiative transfer model and the nested sampling algorithm to retrieve planetary/atmospheric properties from input spectra of different wavelength coverage, R, and S/N. We find that H2O, CO2, and O3 are detectable if S/N\$\textbackslash geq\$10 (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm1.0\$ dex). We find upper limits for N2O (abundance \$\textbackslash leq10\^\{-3\}\$). CO, N2, and O2 are unconstrained in all cases. The limit for a CH4 detection is R \$= 50\$, S/N \$=10\$. We further correctly determine the exoplanet radius (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm10\textbackslash\%\$), surface temperature (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm20\$K), and surface pressure (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm0.5\$ dex). With the current LIFE design, the observation time required to reach the specified S/N amounts to \$\textbackslash sim7\$ weeks with 4x2m apertures. We conclude that a minimum wavelength coverage of \$4-18.5\textbackslash mu\$m, a R of 50 and an S/N of 10 is required. With the current assumptions, the atmospheric characterization of several Earth-like exoplanets at a distance of 10 pc and within a reasonable amount of observing time will require apertures \$\textbackslash geq2\$ meters.},

  abstract = {Recent direct imaging discoveries suggest a new class of massive, distant planets around A stars. These widely separated giants have been interpreted as signs of planet formation driven by gravitational instability, but the viability of this mechanism is not clear-cut. In this paper, we first discuss the local requirements for fragmentation and the initial fragment mass scales. We then consider whether the fragment's subsequent growth can be terminated within the planetary mass regime. Finally, we place disks in the larger context of star formation and disk evolution models. We find that in order for gravitational instability to produce planets, disks must be atypically cold in order to reduce the initial fragment mass. In addition, fragmentation must occur during a narrow window of disk evolution, after infall has mostly ceased, but while the disk is still sufficiently massive to undergo gravitational instability. Under more typical conditions, disk-born objects will likely grow well above the deuterium burning planetary mass limit. We conclude that if planets are formed by gravitational instability, they must be the low-mass tail of the distribution of disk-born companions. To validate this theory, ongoing direct imaging surveys must find a greater abundance of brown dwarf and M-star companions to A stars. Their absence would suggest planet formation by a different mechanism such as core accretion, which is consistent with the debris disks detected in these systems. \textcopyright{} 2010.

To help guide and inform the search for potentially habitable and ultimately inhabited environments, we begin by summarizing the CHNOPS budget of various reservoirs on Earth, their role in shaping our biosphere, and their origins in the Solar Nebula. We then synthesize our current understanding of how these elements behave and are distributed in diverse astrophysical settings, tracing their journeys from synthesis in dying stars to molecular clouds, protoplanetary settings, and ultimately temperate rocky planets around main sequence stars. We end by identifying key branching points during this journey, highlighting instances where a forming planets' distribution of CHNOPS can be altered dramatically, and speculating about the consequences for the chemical habitability of these worlds.},

Atmospheric gases such as oxygen and methane are promising candidates for such environmental modification due to the evolutionary benefits their production would confer. However, confirming that these gases are produced by life, rather than by geochemical or astrophysical processes, will require a thorough understanding of planetary context, including the expected counterfactual atmospheric evolution for lifeless planets. Here, we evaluate current understanding of planetary context for several candidate biosignatures and their upcoming observability. We review the contextual framework for oxygen and describe how conjectured abiotic oxygen scenarios may be testable. In contrast to oxygen, current understanding of how planetary context controls non-biological methane (CH4) production is limited, even though CH4 biosignatures in anoxic atmospheres may be readily detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess environmental context for CH4 biosignatures and conclude that abundant atmospheric CH4 coexisting with CO2, and CO:CH4 {$\ll$} 1 is suggestive of biological production, although precise thresholds are dependent on stellar context and sparsely characterized abiotic CH4 scenarios. A planetary context framework is also considered for alternative or agnostic biosignatures. Whatever the distribution of life in the Universe, observations of terrestrial exoplanets in coming decades will provide a quantitative understanding of the atmospheric evolution of lifeless worlds. This knowledge will inform future instrument requirements to either corroborate the presence of life elsewhere or confirm its apparent absence.},

The global efficacy of these mechanisms, however, hinges on the transfer of reduced iron from the molten silicate mantle to the metal core. Scaling analysis indicates that turbulent diffusion in the internal magma oceans of sub-Neptunes can kinetically entrain liquid iron droplets and quench core formation. This suggests that the chemical equilibration between core, mantle, and atmosphere may be energetically limited by convective overturn in the magma flow. Hence, molten super-Earths possibly retain a compositional memory of their accretion path. Redox control by magma ocean circulation is positively correlated with planetary heat flow, internal gravity, and planet size. The presence and speciation of remanent atmospheres, surface mineralogy, and core mass fraction of primary envelope-stripped exoplanets may thus constrain magma ocean dynamics.},

For this purpose, the photometric data of 40 nearby ultra-cool dwarfs were reanalysed in a self-consistent and fully automated manner starting from the raw images. The pipeline developed specifically for this task generates differential light curves, removes non-planetary photometric features and stellar variability, and searches for transits. It identifies the transits of TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c without any human intervention. To test the pipeline and the potential output of similar surveys, we injected planetary transits into the light curves on a star-by-star basis and tested whether the pipeline is able to detect them. The achieved photometric precision enables us to identify Earth-sized planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs as validated by the injection tests. Our planet-injection simulation further suggests a lower limit of 10 per cent on the occurrence rate of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1b with a radius between 1 and 1.3 \$R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ and the orbital period between 1.4 and 1.8 days.},

  abstract = {The Solar System's orbital structure is thought to have been sculpted by an episode of dynamical instability among the giant planets1\textendash 4. However, the instability trigger and timing have not been clearly established5\textendash 9. Hydrodynamical modelling has shown that while the Sun's gaseous protoplanetary disk was present the giant planets migrated into a compact orbital configuration in a chain of resonances2,10. Here we use dynamical simulations to show that the giant planets' instability was probably triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. As the disk evaporated from the inside out, its inner edge swept successively across and dynamically perturbed each planet's orbit in turn. The associated orbital shift caused a dynamical compression of the exterior part of the system, ultimately triggering instability. The final orbits of our simulated systems match those of the Solar System for a viable range of astrophysical parameters. The giant planet instability therefore took place as the gaseous disk dissipated, constrained by astronomical observations to be a few to ten million years after the birth of the Solar System11. Terrestrial planet formation would not complete until after such an early giant planet instability12,13; the growing terrestrial planets may even have been sculpted by its perturbations, explaining the small mass of Mars relative to Earth14.},

These limitations will require crews to operate with greater autonomy than any past space mission has demonstrated. The Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) project, which regularly sends small teams of researchers to remote parts of the southern continent, resembles a space mission in many ways but does not rely upon a control center. It provides a useful crew autonomy model for planners of future deep space exploration missions. In contrast to current space missions, ANSMET gives the crew the authority to adjust competing work priorities, task assignments, and daily schedules; allows the crew to be the primary monitor of mission progress; demands greater crew accountability for operational errors; requires the crew to make the most of limited communication bandwidth; adopts systems designed for simple operation and failure recovery; and grants the crew a leading role in the selection and stowage of their equipment.},

  abstract = {The study of stellar surfaces can reveal information about the chemical composition, interior structure, and magnetic properties of stars. It is also critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches, which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.},

  abstract = {With the growing number of spectroscopic observations and observational platforms capable of exoplanet atmospheric characterization, there is a growing need for analysis techniques that can distill information about a large population of exoplanets into a coherent picture of atmospheric trends expressed within the statistical sample. In this work, we develop a Hierarchical Bayesian Atmospheric Retrieval (HBAR) model to infer population-level trends in exoplanet atmospheric characteristics. We demonstrate HBAR on the case of inferring a trend in atmospheric CO2 with incident stellar flux, predicted by the presence of a functioning carbonate-silicate weathering negative feedback cycle, an assumption upon which all calculations of the habitable zone (HZ) rest. Using simulated transmission spectra and JWST-quality observations of rocky planets with H2O, CO2, and N2 bearing atmospheres, we find that the predicted trend in CO2 causes subtle differences in the spectra of order 10 ppm in the 1-5 um range, underscoring the challenge inherent to testing this hypothesis. In the limit of highly precise data (100 stacked transits per planet), we show that our HBAR model is capable of inferring the population-level parameters that characterize the trend in CO2, and we demonstrate that the null hypothesis and other simpler trends can be rejected at high confidence. Although we find that this specific empirical test of the HZ may be prohibitively challenging in the JWST era, the HBAR framework developed in this work may find a more immediate usage for the analysis of gas giant spectra observed with JWST, Ariel, and other upcoming missions.}

This mission will encompass a very large ({$>$}2100 deg\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}) field of view, granting it the potential to survey up to one million stars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget of the spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar sample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to perform on-board data reduction is mandatory.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We employ mask-based (aperture) photometry to produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We considered three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and weighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a novel direct method. Each model was tested on synthetic images generated for 50 000 potential PLATO targets. We extracted the stellar population from the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 catalogue. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We determined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and frequency of threshold crossing events.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our results show that, although the binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious signals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects considerably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the former to deliver up to {$\sim$}30\% less false transit signatures at 7.1\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$} detection threshold.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be decisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum planet yield and substantially reduced occurrence of false positives for the PLATO mission. Overall, this work constitutes an important step in the design of both on-board and on-ground science data processing pipelines.}}}}}}}}},

Here, we attempt to determine the degree of alignment between the orbital planes of the cold Jupiters and the inner super-Earths. The key observational input is the fraction of Kepler stars with transiting super-Earths that also have transiting cold Jupiters. This fraction depends on both the probability for cold Jupiters to occur in such systems, and on the mutual orbital inclinations. Since the probability of occurrence has already been measured in Doppler surveys, we can use the data to constrain the dispersion of the mutual inclination distribution. We find \$\textbackslash backslashsigma=11.8\^\{+12.7\}\_\{-5.5\}\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (68\% confidence) and \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\textbackslash textgreater3.5\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (95\% confidence), where \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ is the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distribution. This suggests that planetary orbits in systems with cold Jupiters tend to be coplanar - although not quite as coplanar as those in the Solar System, which have a mean inclination from the invariable plane of \$1.8\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$. We also find evidence that cold Jupiters have lower mutual inclinations relative to inner systems with higher transit multiplicity. This suggests a link between the dynamical excitation in the inner and outer systems. For example, perturbations from misaligned cold Jupiters may dynamically heat or destabilize systems of inner super-Earths.},

In this paper, we numerically study the formation of planetary systems via pebble accretion and investigate the effects of disc properties such as masses, dissipation timescales, and metallicities on planet formation outcomes. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We improved the N-body code SyMBA that was modified for our Paper I by taking account of new planet-disc interaction models and type II migration. We adopted the `two-{$\alpha$}' disc model to mimic the effects of both the standard disc turbulence and the mass accretion driven by the magnetic disc wind. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We successfully reproduced the overall distribution trends of semi-major axes, eccentricities, and planetary masses of extrasolar giant planets. There are two types of giant planet formation trends, depending on whether or not the disc's dissipation timescales are comparable to the planet formation timescales. When planet formation happens fast enough, giant planets are fully grown (Jupiter mass or higher) and are distributed widely across the disc. On the other hand, when planet formation is limited by the disc's dissipation, discs generally form low-mass cold Jupiters. Our simulations also naturally explain why hot Jupiters (HJs) tend to be alone and how the observed eccentricity-metallicity trends arise. The low-metallicity discs tend to form nearly circular and coplanar HJs in situ, because planet formation is slower than high-metallicity discs, and thus protoplanetary cores migrate significantly before gas accretion. The high-metallicity discs, on the other hand, generate HJs in situ or via tidal circularisation of eccentric orbits. Both pathways usually involve dynamical instabilities, and thus HJs tend to have broader eccentricity and inclination distributions. When giant planets with very wide orbits ("super-cold Jupiters") are formed via pebble accretion followed by scattering, we predict that they belong to metal-rich stars, have eccentric orbits, and tend to have (\textasciitilde 80\%) companions interior to their orbits.},

We observed a substantial brightening of the debris disk at a wavelength of 3 to 5 micrometers, followed by a decay over a year, with quasi-periodic modulations of the disk flux. The behavior is consistent with the occurrence of a violent impact that produced vapor out of which a thick cloud of silicate spherules condensed that were then ground into dust by collisions.

The number of planets with optical phase curve detections, however, is currently too small to study them as an aggregate population, motivating an extension of the search to non-transiting planets. Here we present an algorithm for the detection of non-transiting, short-period giant planets in the Kepler field. The procedure uses the phase curves themselves as evidence for the planets' existence. We employ a supervised learning algorithm to recognize the salient time-dependent properties of synthetic phase curves; we then search for detections of signals that match these properties. After demonstrating the algorithm's capabilities, we classify 142,630 FGK Kepler stars without confirmed planets or KOIs and, for each one, assign a probability of a phase curve of a non-transiting planet being present. We identify 60 high-probability non-transiting hot Jupiter candidates. We also derive constraints on the candidates' albedos and offsets of the phase curve maxima. These targets are strong candidates for follow-up radial velocity confirmation and characterization.

  abstract = {The widespread prevalence of close-in, nearly coplanar super-Earth- and sub-Neptune-sized planets in multiple-planet systems was one of the most surprising results from the Kepler mission. By studying a uniform sample of Kepler "multis" with mass measurements from transit timing variations (TTVs), we show that a given planetary system tends to harbor a characteristic type of planet. That is, planets in a system have both masses and radii that are far more similar than if the system were assembled randomly from planets in the population. This finding has two important ramifications. First, the large intrinsic compositional scatter in the planet mass-radius relation is dominated by system-to-system variance rather than intra-system variance. Second, if provided enough properties of the star and primordial protoplanetary disk, there may be a substantial degree of predictability in the outcome of the planet formation process. We show that stellar mass and metallicity account for of order \$20\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the variation in outcomes; the remainder is as-yet unknown.},

After compiling various radial velocity and high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a {$<$} 1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close planets at 15\$\_\{-12\}\^\{+17\}\$ per cent the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries with a {$>$} 200 au have a negligible effect on close planet formation. We show that F = 43 {$\pm$} 7 per cent of solar-type primaries in magnitude-limited samples do not host close planets due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter and close Neptune occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. Additionally, about half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets towards low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction.},

Existing studies commonly try to constrain atmospheric abundances, or to analyze what abundance patterns a given description of planet formation predicts. However, there is also a pressing need to develop methodologies that investigate how to transform atmospheric compositions into planetary formation inferences. In this study we summarize the complexities and uncertainties of state-of-the-art planet formation models and how they influence planetary atmospheric compositions. We introduce a methodology that explores the effect of different formation model assumptions when interpreting atmospheric compositions. We apply this framework to the directly imaged planet HR 8799e. Based on its atmospheric composition, this planet may have migrated significantly during its formation. We show that including the chemical evolution of the protoplanetary disk leads to a reduced need for migration. Moreover, we find that pebble accretion can reproduce the planet's composition, but some of our tested setups lead to too low atmospheric metallicities, even when considering that evaporating pebbles may enrich the disk gas. We conclude that the definitive inversion from atmospheric abundances to planet formation for a given planet may be challenging, but a qualitative understanding of the effects of different formation models is possible, opening up pathways for new investigations.},

  abstract = {The Kepler spacecraft has discovered a large number of planets with up to one-year periods and down to terrestrial sizes. While the majority of the target stars are main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with effective temperatures as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These cooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone, yet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK stars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of different spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the star and show that they are significantly different from each other. We further identify two trends. First, the occurrence of Earth- to Neptune-sized planets (1\textendash 4 R{$\oplus$}) is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital periods probed by Kepler; planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as around G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in planet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a {$\sim$}10 day orbital period, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median stellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is stellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of stellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping, and destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the pre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of migrating planets or planetary building blocks close to the star. These results demonstrate the stellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence rate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the inner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration of planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters.},

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass accretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in the disk. We calculate the snow-line location from recent observations of mass accretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial disk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow-line locations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow-line locations of {$\sim$}0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the 1{$\sigma$} snow-line location among solar-mass stars of the same age ranges from {$\sim$}2 to {$\sim$}5 AU. For more realistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located up to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of N-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial planets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion in snow-line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like dust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around Sun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of low-mass M stars ( 0.5 \{M\}{$\odot$} ) as in previous works. The closer-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the habitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars. Considering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host most of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are able to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution.},

Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42\% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au could be as high as 100\% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars of eta\_earth=36+-14\%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than {$\sim$}8\% and {$\sim$}3\% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.},

We use a pebble drift and accretion model to simulate the growth of planet cores inside and outside of the snow line. A smaller pebble size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 M {$\odot$} and for a range of initial disk masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets are anticorrelated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial-velocity surveys. A key testable prediction of the pebble accretion hypothesis is that the occurrence rates of super-Earths should decrease again for M dwarfs near the substellar boundary like Trappist-1.},

However, dust mass measurements of Class II disks with ALMA have called into question whether they contain enough solids to build the exoplanets that have been detected to date. In this paper, we calculate the mass and spatial scale of solid material around Sun-like stars probed by transit and radial velocity exoplanet surveys, and compare those to the observed dust masses and sizes of Class II disks in the same stellar mass regime. We show that the apparent mass discrepancy disappears when accounting for observational selection and detection biases. We find a discrepancy only when the planet formation efficiency is below 100\%, or if there is a population of undetected exoplanets that significantly contributes to the mass in solids. We identify a positive correlation between the masses of planetary systems and their respective orbital periods, which is consistent with the trend between the masses and the outer radii of Class II dust disks. This implies that, despite a factor 100 difference in spatial scale, the properties of protoplanetary disks seem to be imprinted on the exoplanet population.}

  abstract = {The similar orbital distances and detection rates of debris disks and the prominent rings observed in protoplanetary disks suggest a potential connection between these structures. We explore this connection with new calculations that follow the evolution of rings of pebbles and planetesimals as they grow into planets and generate dusty debris. Depending on the initial solid mass and planetesimal formation efficiency, the calculations predict diverse outcomes for the resulting planet masses and accompanying debris signature. When compared with debris disk incidence rates as a function of luminosity and time, the model results indicate that the known population of bright cold debris disks can be explained by rings of solids with the (high) initial masses inferred for protoplanetary disk rings and modest planetesimal formation efficiencies that are consistent with current theories of planetesimal formation. These results support the possibility that large protoplanetary disk rings evolve into the known cold debris disks. The inferred strong evolutionary connection between protoplanetary disks with large rings and mature stars with cold debris disks implies that the remaining majority population of low-mass stars with compact protoplanetary disks leaves behind only modest masses of residual solids at large radii and evolves primarily into mature stars without detectable debris beyond 30 au. The approach outlined here illustrates how combining observations with detailed evolutionary models of solids strongly constrains the global evolution of disk solids and underlying physical parameters such as the efficiency of planetesimal formation and the possible existence of invisible reservoirs of solids in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars is an ESA M-class satellite planned for launch by the end of 2026 and dedicated to the wide-field search of transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, with a strong focus on discovering habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. The choice of the fields to be pointed at is a crucial task since it has a direct impact on the scientific return of the mission. In this paper, we describe and discuss the formal requirements and the key scientific prioritization criteria that have to be taken into account in the Long-duration Observation Phase (LOP) field selection, and apply a quantitative metric to guide us in this complex optimization process. We identify two provisional LOP fields, one for each hemisphere (LOPS1 and LOPN1), and we discuss their properties and stellar content. While additional fine-tuning shall be applied to LOP selection before the definitive choice, which is set to be made two years before launch, we expect that their position will not move by more than a few degrees with respect to what is proposed in this paper.},

We explore water worlds within the framework of a joint mass-radius-period distribution of planets fit to a sample of transiting Kepler exoplanets, a subset of which have radial velocity mass measurements. We employ hierarchical Bayesian modeling to create a range of ten mixture models that include multiple compositional subpopulations of exoplanets. We model these subpopulations - including planets with gaseous envelopes, evaporated rocky cores, evaporated icy cores, intrinsically rocky planets, and intrinsically icy planets - in different combinations in order to assess which combinations are most favored by the data. Using cross-validation, we evaluate the support for models that include planets with icy compositions compared to the support for models that do not, finding broad support for both. We find significant population-level degeneracies between subpopulations of water worlds and planets with primordial envelopes. Among models that include one or more icy-core subpopulations, we find a wide range for the fraction of planets with icy compositions, with a rough upper limit of 50\%. Improved datasets or alternative modeling approaches may better be able to distinguish between these subpopulations of planets.},

This effect is particularly of concern for M dwarfs, which can remain magnetically active for billions of years. We compile rotation periods for late-type stars and for the M dwarf planet-host sample in order to investigate the rotation periods of older field stars across the main sequence. We show that for stars with masses between 0.25 and 0.5 (M4V\textendash M1V), the stellar rotation period typical of field stars coincides with the orbital periods of planets in the habitable zone. This will pose a fundamental challenge to the discovery and characterization of potentially habitable planets around early M dwarfs. Due to the longer rotation periods reached by mid M dwarfs and the shorter orbital period at which the planetary habitable zone is found, stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.25 (M6V\textendash M4V) offer better opportunities for the detection of habitable planets via radial velocities.},

However, there is surprisingly little training in graduate school on how to develop this essential skill [Zimmerman et al., 2011] or discussion of best practices to ensure that reviewers at all levels efficiently provide the most useful review. Even more challenging for the novice peer reviewer is that journals also vary widely in their review guidelines. Nonetheless, the goals of peer review are crystal clear: to ensure the accuracy and improve the quality of published literature through constructive criticism. To make the peer review process as efficient and productive as possible, you may want to consider a few useful approaches to tackling major steps throughout your review, from contemplating a review request and reading and assessing the manuscript to writing the review and interacting with the journal's editors (see Figure 1). These tips are particularly relevant for graduate students or other first-time reviewers, but they may also be useful to experienced reviewers and to journal editors seeking to enhance their publication's processes.},

The WFIRST mission was chosen as the top-priority large space mission of the 2010 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey in order to achieve three primary goals: to study dark energy via a wide-field imaging survey, to study exoplanets via a microlensing survey, and to enable a guest observer program. Here we assess the ability of the several WFIRST designs to achieve the goal of the microlensing survey to discover a large sample of cold, low-mass exoplanets with semimajor axes beyond roughly one astronomical unit, which are largely impossible to detect with any other technique. We present the results of a suite of simulations that span the full range of the proposed WFIRST architectures, from the original design envisioned by the decadal survey, to the current design, which utilizes a 2.4 m telescope donated to NASA. By studying such a broad range of architectures, we are able to determine the impact of design trades on the expected yields of detected exoplanets. In estimating the yields we take particular care to ensure that our assumed Galactic model predicts microlensing event rates that match observations, consider the impact that inaccuracies in the Galactic model might have on the yields, and ensure that numerical errors in light-curve computations do not bias the yields for the smallest-mass exoplanets. For the nominal baseline WFIRST design and a fiducial planet mass function, we predict that a total of {$\sim$}1400 bound exoplanets with mass greater than {$\sim$}0.1 M {$\oplus$} should be detected, including {$\sim$}200 with mass {$\lessequivlnt$}3 M {$\oplus$}. WFIRST should have sensitivity to planets with mass down to {$\sim$}0.02 M {$\oplus$}, or roughly the mass of Ganymede.},

Our assessment is based on a large representative sample of host stars from the TRILEGAL Galaxy population synthesis model, recent estimates of the exoplanet frequency distributions as a function of stellar type, and detailed simulation of the Gaia observations using the updated instrument performance and scanning law. We use two approaches to estimate detectable planetary systems: one based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the astrometric signature per field crossing, easily reproducible and allowing comparisons with previous estimates, and a new and more robust metric based on orbit fitting to the simulated satellite data. With some plausible assumptions on planet occurrences, we find that some 21,000 ({$\pm$}6000) high-mass ({$\sim$}1\textendash 15MJ) long-period planets should be discovered out to distances of {$\sim$}500 pc for the nominal 5 yr mission (including at least 1000\textendash 1500 around M dwarfs out to 100 pc), rising to some 70,000 ({$\pm$}20, 000) for a 10 yr mission.

The disk around CIDA 1 (\textasciitilde 0.1\textendash 0.2 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) is one of the very few known disks that host a large cavity (20 au radius in size) around a very low-mass star.

These new ALMA observations reveal a very bright and unresolved inner disk, a shallow spectral index of the dust emission (\textasciitilde 2), and a complex morphology of a ring located at 20 au. We also present X-shooter (VLT) observations that confirm the high accretion rate of CIDA 1 of \emph{\.M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{acc{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 1.4 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-8{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}.

When comparing these observations with models that combine planet\textendash disk interaction, dust evolution, and radiative transfer, we exclude planets more massive than 0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Jup{$<$}sub/{$>$} as the potential origin of the large cavity because with these it is difficult to maintain a long-lived and bright inner disk. Even in this planet mass regime, an additional physical process may be needed to stop the particles from migrating inwards and to maintain a bright inner disk on timescales of millions of years. Such mechanisms include a trap formed by a very close-in extra planet or the inner edge of a dead zone. The low spectral index of the disk around CIDA 1 is difficult to explain and challenges our current dust evolution models, in particular processes like fragmentation, growth, and diffusion of particles inside pressure bumps.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {One of the long-term goals of exoplanet science is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small exoplanets in order to understand their diversity and search for habitable worlds and potential biosignatures. Achieving this goal requires a space mission of sufficient scale. We seek to quantify the exoplanet detection performance of a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer that measures the thermal emission of exoplanets. For this, we have developed an instrument simulator that considers all major astrophysical noise sources and coupled it with Monte Carlo simulations of a synthetic exoplanet population around main-sequence stars within 20 pc. This allows us to quantify the number (and types) of exoplanets that our mission concept could detect over a certain time period. Two different scenarios to distribute the observing time among the stellar targets are discussed and different apertures sizes and wavelength ranges are considered. Within a 2.5-year initial search phase, an interferometer consisting of four 2 m apertures with a total instrument throughput of 5\% covering a wavelength range between 4 and 18.5 \$\textbackslash mu\$m could detect up to \textasciitilde 550 exoplanets with radii between 0.5 and 6 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ with an integrated SNR\$\textbackslash ge\$7. At least \textasciitilde 160 of the detected exoplanets have radii \$\textbackslash le\$1.5 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$. Depending on the observing scenario, \textasciitilde 25-45 rocky exoplanets (objects with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 \$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$) orbiting within the empirical habitable zone (eHZ) of their host stars are among the detections. With an aperture size of 3.5 m, the total number of detections can increase to up to \textasciitilde 770, including \textasciitilde 60-80 rocky, eHZ planets. With 1 m aperture size, the maximum detection yield is \textasciitilde 315 exoplanets, including \$\textbackslash le\$20 rocky, eHZ planets. In terms of predicted detection yield, such a mission can compete with large single-aperture reflected light missions. (abridged)},

  abstract = {The CARMENES radial-velocity survey is currently searching for planets in a sample of 387 M dwarfs. Here we report on two Saturn-mass planets orbiting TYC 2187-512-1 (\$M\_\textbackslash star = 0.50 M\_\textbackslash odot\$) and TZ Ari (\$M\_\textbackslash star = 0.15 M\_\textbackslash odot\$), respectively. We obtained supplementary photometric time series, which we use along with spectroscopic information to determine the rotation periods of the two stars. In both cases, the radial velocities also show strong modulations at the respective rotation period. We thus modeled the radial velocities as a Keplerian orbit plus a Gaussian process representing the stellar variability. TYC 2187-512-1 is found to harbor a planet with a minimum mass of 0.33 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$ in a near-circular 692-day orbit. The companion of TZ Ari has a minimum mass of 0.21 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$, orbital period of 771 d, and orbital eccentricity of 0.46. We provide an overview of all known giant planets in the CARMENES sample, from which we infer an occurrence rate of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs with periods up to 2 years in the range between 2\% to 6\%. TZ Ari b is only the second giant planet discovered orbiting a host with mass less than 0.3 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$. These objects occupy an extreme location in the planet mass versus host mass plane. It is difficult to explain their formation in core-accretion scenarios, so they may possibly have been formed through a disk fragmentation process.},

We find that \$41\^\{+15\}\_\{-13\}\textbackslash\%\$ of systems with a close-in, small planet also host an outer giant, compared to \$17.6\^\{+2.4\}\_\{-1.9\}\textbackslash\%\$ for stars irrespective of small planet presence. This implies that small planet hosts may be enhanced in outer giant occurrence compared to all stars with \$1.7\textbackslash sigma\$ significance. Conversely, we estimate that \$42\^\{+17\}\_\{-13\}\textbackslash\%\$ of cold giant hosts also host an inner small planet, compared to \$27.6\^\{+5.8\}\_\{-4.8\}\textbackslash\%\$ of stars irrespective of cold giant presence. We also find that more massive and close-in giant planets are not associated with small inner planets. Specifically, our sample indicates that small planets are less likely to host outer giant companions more massive than approximately 120 Earth masses and within 0.3--3 au than to host less massive or more distant giant companions, with \$\textbackslash sim\$2.2\$\textbackslash sigma\$ confidence. This implies that massive gas giants within 0.3--3 au may suppress inner small planet formation. Additionally, we compare the host-star metallicity distributions for systems with only small planets and those with both small planets and cold giants. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stars in our survey that only host small planets have a metallicity distribution that is consistent with the broader solar-metallicity-median sample, while stars that host both small planets and gas giants are distinctly metal-rich with \$\textbackslash sim\$2.3\$\textbackslash sigma\$ confidence.},

ESA's PLATO space mission, to be launched by the end of 2026, aims to detect and characterise Earth-like planets in their habitable zone using asteroseismology and the analysis of the transit events. The preparation of science objectives will require the implementation of hare-and-hound exercises relying on the massive generation of representative simulated light-curves.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We developed a light-curve simulator named the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator (PSLS) in order to generate light-curves representative of typical PLATO targets, that is showing simultaneously solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, PSLS also aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of the PLATO multi-telescope concept.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected for PLATO. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board and also simulate the quasi-regular updates of the aperture masks during the observations. The simulated light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument point spread functions reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight calibration phases of the mission. These corrected and simulated light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in PSLS. Simulation of the oscillations and granulation signals rely on current state-of-the-art stellar seismology.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only at frequencies below {$\sim$}20 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}Hz. The systematic errors level is found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions with observations made by \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement with the observations.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. PSLS reproduces the main properties of expected PLATO light-curves. Its speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative of the PLATO cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the PLATO mission.}}}}}}}},

A tidal evolution analysis showed a large tidal dissipation timescale, suggesting that the planet is not a progenitor for a hot Jupiter caught during its high-eccentricity migration.

These results raise the question of whether this trend can be reproduced and explained by planet formation theory.                                         Aims.               Here, we investigate the properties of inner super-Earths and outer giant planets that form according to a core accretion scenario. We study the mutual relations between these planet species in synthetic planetary systems and compare them to the observed exoplanet population.                                         Methods.               We invoked the Generation 3 Bern model of planet formation and evolution to simulate 1000 multi-planet systems.

Results.               The formation of warm super-Earths and cold Jupiters in the same system is enhanced compared to the individual appearances, although it is weaker than what has been proposed through observations. We attribute the discrepancy to warm and dynamically active giant planets that frequently disrupt the inner systems, particularly in high-metallicity environments. In general, a joint occurrence of the two planet types requires intermediate solid reservoirs in the originating protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, we find differences in the volatile content of planets in different system architectures and predict that high-density super-Earths are more likely to host an outer giant. This correlation can be tested observationally.},

  abstract = {Context.               State-of-the-art planet formation models are now capable of accounting for the full spectrum of known planet types. This comes at the cost of an increasing complexity of the models, which calls into question whether established links between their initial conditions and the calculated planetary observables are preserved.                                         Aims.               In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to investigate the relations between clusters of synthetic planets with similar properties and their formation history.                                         Methods.               We trained a Gaussian mixture model on typical exoplanet observables computed by a global model of planet formation to identify clusters of similar planets. We then traced back the formation histories of the planets associated with them and pinpointed their differences. Using the cluster affiliation as labels, we trained a random forest classifier to predict planet species from properties of the originating protoplanetary disk.                                         Results.               Without presupposing any planet types, we identified four distinct classes in our synthetic population. They roughly correspond to the observed populations of (sub-)Neptunes, giant planets, and (super-)Earths, plus an additional unobserved class we denote as ``icy cores''. These groups emerge already within the first 0.1 Myr of the formation phase and are predicted from disk properties with an overall accuracy of {$>$}90\%. The most reliable predictors are the initial orbital distance of planetary nuclei and the total planetesimal mass available. Giant planets form only in a particular region of this parameter space that is in agreement with purely analytical predictions. Including               N               -body interactions between the planets decreases the predictability, especially for sub-Neptunes that frequently undergo giant collisions and turn into super-Earths.                                         Conclusions.               The processes covered by current core accretion models of planet formation are largely predictable and reproduce the known demographic features in the exoplanet population. The impact of gravitational interactions highlights the need for               N               -body integrators for realistic predictions of systems of low-mass planets.},

  abstract = {Planet formation is sensitive to the conditions in protoplanetary disks, for which scaling laws as a function of stellar mass are known. We aim to test whether the observed population of planets around low-mass stars can be explained by these trends, or if separate formation channels are needed. We address this question by confronting a state-of-the-art planet population synthesis model with a sample of planets around M dwarfs observed by the HARPS and CARMENES radial velocity (RV) surveys. To account for detection biases, we performed injection and retrieval experiments on the actual RV data to produce synthetic observations of planets that we simulated following the core accretion paradigm. These simulations robustly yield the previously reported high occurrence of rocky planets around M dwarfs and generally agree with their planetary mass function. In contrast, our simulations cannot reproduce a population of giant planets around stars less massive than 0.5 solar masses. This potentially indicates an alternative formation channel for giant planets around the least massive stars that cannot be explained with current core accretion theories. We further find a stellar mass dependency in the detection rate of short-period planets. A lack of close-in planets around the earlier-type stars (\$M\_\textbackslash star \textbackslash gtrsim 0.4\textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$) in our sample remains unexplained by our model and indicates dissimilar planet migration barriers in disks of different spectral subtypes. Both discrepancies can be attributed to gaps in our understanding of planet migration in nascent M dwarf systems. They underline the different conditions around young stars of different spectral subtypes, and the importance of taking these differences into account when studying planet formation.},

  abstract = {\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We determine the radii and masses of 293 nearby, bright M dwarfs of the CARMENES survey. This is the first time that such a large and homogeneous high-resolution (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} {$>$} 80 000) spectroscopic survey has been used to derive these fundamental stellar parameters.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We derived the radii using Stefan\textendash Boltzmann's law. We obtained the required effective temperatures \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} from a spectral analysis and we obtained the required luminosities \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$} from integrated broadband photometry together with the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 parallaxes. The mass was then determined using a mass-radius relation that we derived from eclipsing binaries known in the literature. We compared this method with three other methods: (1) We calculated the mass from the radius and the surface gravity log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$}, which was obtained from the same spectral analysis as \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$}. (2) We used a widely used infrared mass-magnitude relation. (3) We used a Bayesian approach to infer stellar parameters from the comparison of the absolute magnitudes and colors of our targets with evolutionary models.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}.

  abstract = {Recent observations have uncovered a correlation between the accretion rates (measured from the UV continuum excess) of protoplanetary discs and their masses inferred from observations of the submm continuum. While viscous evolution models predict such a correlation, the predicted values are in tension with data obtained from the Lupus and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions; for example, they underpredict the scatter in accretion rates, particularly in older regions. Here, we argue that since the submm observations trace the discs' dust, by explicitly modelling the dust grain growth, evolution, and emission, we can better understand the correlation. We show that for turbulent viscosities with {$\alpha$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 10-3, the depletion of dust from the disc due to radial drift means we can reproduce the range of masses and accretion rates seen in the Lupus and Upper Sco data sets. One consequence of this model is that the upper locus of accretion rates at a given dust mass does not evolve with the age of the region. Moreover, we find that internal photoevaporation is necessary to produce the lowest accretion rates observed. In order to replicate the correct dust masses at the time of disc dispersal, we favour relatively low photoevaporation rates {$\lessequivlnt$} 10-9~M{$\odot~$}yr-1 for most sources but cannot discriminate between EUV or X-ray-driven winds. A limited number of sources, particularly in Lupus, are shown to have higher masses than predicted by our models which may be evidence for variations in the properties of the dust or dust trapping induced in substructures.},

  abstract = {Cool M dwarfs within a few tens of parsecs from the Sun are becoming the focus of dedicated observational programs in the realm of exoplanet astrophysics. Gaia, in its all-sky survey of \&gt;109 objects, will deliver precision astrometry for a magnitude-limited (V~=~20) sample of M dwarfs. We investigate some aspects of the synergy between the Gaia astrometric data on nearby M dwarfs and other ground-based and space-borne programs for planet detection and characterization. We carry out numerical simulations to gauge the Gaia potential for precision astrometry of exoplanets orbiting a sample of known dM stars within~{$\sim$}30\,pc from the Sun. We express Gaia detection thresholds as a function of system parameters and in view of the latest mission profile, including the most up-to-date astrometric error model. Our major findings are as follows: (1) it will be possible to accurately determine orbits and masses for Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods in the range 0.2~{$\lessequivlnt~$}P~{$\lessequivlnt~$}6.0~yr and with an astrometric signal-to-noise ratio {$\varsigma$}/{$\sigma$}AL~{$\greaterequivlnt~$}10. Given present-day estimates of the planet fraction fp around M dwarfs, {$\approx$}102 giant planets could be found by Gaia around the sample. Comprehensive screening by Gaia of the reservoir of~{$\sim$}4~\texttimes ~105 M dwarfs within 100\,pc could result in~{$\sim$}2600 detections and as many as~{$\sim$}500 accurate orbit determinations. The value of fp could then be determined with an accuracy of 2~per\,cent, an improvement by over an order of magnitude with respect to the most precise values available to-date; (2) in the same period range, inclination angles corresponding to quasi-edge-on configurations will be determined with enough precision (a few~per\,cent) so that it will be possible to identify intermediate-separation planets which are potentially transiting within the errors. Gaia could alert us of the existence of 10 such systems. More than 250 candidates could be identified assuming solutions compatible with transit configurations within 10~per\,cent accuracy, although a large fraction of these ({$\sim$}85~per\,cent) could be false positives; (3) for well-sampled orbits, the uncertainties on planetary ephemerides, separation {$\varrho$} and position angle \textvartheta{} will degrade at typical rates of {$\Delta\varrho~\&$}lt;~1~mas~yr-1 and {$\Delta\vartheta ~\&$}lt;~2\textdegree ~yr-1, respectively. These are over an order of magnitude smaller than the degradation levels attained by present-day ephemerides predictions based on mas-level precision Hubble Space Telescope/Fine Guidance Sensor astrometry; (4) planetary phases will be measured with typical uncertainties {$\Delta\lambda$} of several degrees, resulting (under the assumption of purely scattering atmospheres) in phase-averaged errors on the phase function {$\Delta\Phi$}({$\lambda$}) {$\approx$} 0.05, and expected uncertainties in the determination of the emergent flux of intermediate-separation (0.3~\&lt;~a~\&lt;~2.0~au) giant planets of~{$\sim$}20~per\,cent. Our results help to quantify the actual relevance of the Gaia astrometric observations of the large sample of nearby M dwarfs in a synergetic effort to optimize the planning and interpretation of follow-up/characterization measurements of the discovered systems by means of transit survey programs, and upcoming and planned ground-based as well as space-borne observatories for direct imaging (e.g. Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research, European Extremely Large Telescope/Planetary Camera and Spectrograph) and simultaneous multiwavelength spectroscopy (e.g. Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory, James Webb Space Telescope).},

However, the lack of discoveries of these planets beyond a few astronomical units from their host stars prompts a better understanding of their orbital architectures from their nascent birth cluster. Here, we perform stellar cluster simulations of 3-planet and 7-planet systems containing super-Earths on initially circular, coplanar orbits. We adopt the typical stellar masses of main-sequence progenitors of white dwarfs (\$1.5\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$-\$2.5\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) as host stars and include 8,000 main-sequence stars following a Kroupa initial mass function in our clusters. Our results reveal that about 30 per cent of the simulated planets generate eccentricities of at least 0.1 by the time of cluster dissolution, which would aid white dwarf pollution. We provide our output parameters to the community for potential use as initial conditions for subsequent evolution simulations.},

The core accretion theory's runaway gas accretion process predicts a dearth of intermediate-mass giant planets that is not seen in the microlensing results. In particular, the models predict {$\sim$} 10 \texttimes{} fewer planets at mass ratios of 10-4 {$\leq$} q {$\leq$} 4 \texttimes{} 10-4 than inferred from microlensing observations. This tension implies that gas giant formation may involve processes that have hitherto been overlooked by existing core accretion models or that the planet-forming environment varies considerably as a function of host-star mass. Variation from the usual assumptions for the protoplanetary disk viscosity and thickness could reduce this discrepancy, but such changes might conflict with microlensing results at larger or smaller mass ratios, or with other observations. The resolution of this discrepancy may have important implications for planetary habitability because it has been suggested that the runaway gas accretion process may have triggered the delivery of water to our inner solar system. So, an understanding of giant planet formation may help us to determine the occurrence rate of habitable planets.},

The advent of Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys has now made it possible, in principle, to infer the properties of individual stars, including most exoplanet hosts, to very high precision. However, we show that, in practice, such analyses are limited by uncertainties in both the fundamental scale and our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured interferometric angular diameters and bolometric fluxes set a systematic uncertainty floor of {$\asymp$}2.4\% in temperature, {$\asymp$}2.0\% in luminosity, and {$\asymp$}4.2\% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest uncertainties of order {$\asymp$}5\% in mass and {$\asymp$}20\% in age for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While the radius uncertainties are roughly constant over this range of stars, the model-dependent uncertainties are a complex function of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets and discuss strategies for reducing these uncertainties in the future.},

The {$\sim$}10 yr baseline between the event and the Keck observations allows the planetary host star to be detected at a separation of 66.5 {$\pm$} 1.7 mas from the source star, consistent with the light-curve model prediction. The combination of the host star brightness and light-curve parameters yields host star and planet masses of Mhost = 0.524 {$\pm$} 0.048M{$\odot$} and mp = 67.3 {$\pm$} 6.2M{$\oplus$} at a distance of DL = 7.1 {$\pm$} 0.7 kpc. The star-planet projected separation is 2.03 {$\pm$} 0.21 au. The planet-to-star mass ratio of this system, q = (3.857 {$\pm$} 0.029) \texttimes{} 10-4, places it in the predicted "planet desert" at 10-4 {$<$} q {$<$} 4 \texttimes{} 10-4 according to the runaway gas accretion scenario of the core accretion theory. Seven of the 30 planets in the Suzuki et al. sample fall in this mass ratio range, and this is the third with a measured host mass. All three of these host stars have masses of 0.5 {$\leq$} Mhost/M{$\odot$} {$\leq$} 0.7, which implies that this predicted mass ratio gap is filled with planets that have host stars within a factor of two of 1M{$\odot$}. This suggests that runaway gas accretion does not play a major role in determining giant planet masses for stars somewhat less massive than the Sun. Our analysis has been accomplished with a modified DAOPHOT code that has been designed to measure the brightness and positions of closely blended stars. This will aid in the development of the primary method that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope mission will use to determine the masses of microlens planets and their hosts.},

The paper published in 1983 in the Venus book summarized the discoveries and findings of the US Pioneer Venus and a series of Soviet Venera spacecraft (Esposito et al. in Venus, p.~484, 1983). Due to the emphasis on in-situ investigations from descent probes, those missions established the basic features of the Venus cloud system, its vertical structure, composition and microphysical properties. Since then, significant progress in understanding of the Venus clouds has been achieved due to exploitation of new observation techniques onboard Galileo and Messenger flyby spacecraft and Venus Express and Akatsuki orbiters. They included detailed investigation of the mesospheric hazes in solar and stellar occultation geometry applied in the broad spectral range from UV to thermal IR. Imaging spectroscopy in the near-IR transparency ``windows'' on the night side opened a new and very effective way of sounding the deep atmosphere. This technique together with near-simultaneous UV imaging enabled comprehensive study of the cloud morphology from the cloud top to its deep layers. Venus Express operated from April 2006 until December 2014 and provided a continuous data set characterizing Venus clouds and hazes over a time span of almost 14 Venus years thus enabling a detailed study of temporal and spatial variability. The polar orbit of Venus Express allowed complete latitudinal coverage. These studies are being complemented by JAXA Akatsuki orbiter that began observations in May 2016. This paper reviews the current status of our knowledge of the Venus cloud system focusing mainly on the results acquired after the Venera, Pioneer Venus and Vega missions.},

We use the dust continuum emission at 0.87 and 9 mm to measure the dust disk radii and masses toward the Class 0, Class I, and flat-spectrum protostars, characterizing the evolution of these disk properties in the protostellar phase. The mean dust disk radii for the Class 0, Class I, and flat-spectrum protostars are , , and au, respectively, and the mean protostellar dust disk masses are 25.9, , , respectively. The decrease in dust disk masses is expected from disk evolution and accretion, but the decrease in disk radii may point to the initial conditions of star formation not leading to the systematic growth of disk radii or that radial drift is keeping the dust disk sizes small. At least 146 protostellar disks (35\% of 379 detected 0.87 mm continuum sources plus 42 nondetections) have disk radii greater than 50 au in our sample. These properties are not found to vary significantly between different regions within Orion.

Furthermore, our periodogram analysis of the precise RVs shows strong evidence for a short-period Doppler signal in the residuals of a two-planet Keplerian fit, which we interpret as a third, Saturn-mass planet with \$m\_\textbackslash mathrm\{d\}\textbackslash sin\{i\}\$ = 0.20\$\_\{-0.03\}\^\{+0.02\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$ on a close-in orbit with an orbital period of \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm d\}\$ =89.9\$\_\{-0.1\}\^\{+0.1\}\$ d. We study the dynamical behavior of the three-planet system configurations with an N-body integration scheme, finding it long-term stable with the planets alternating between low and moderate eccentricities episodes. We also performed N-body simulations, including stellar evolution and second-order dynamical effects such as planet-stellar tides and stellar mass-loss on the way to the white dwarf phase. We find that planets HD33142 b, c and d are likely to be engulfed near the tip of the red giant branch phase due to tidal migration. These results make the HD33142 system an essential benchmark for the planet population statistics of the multiple-planet systems found around evolved stars.},

  abstract = {Mass-radius relationships for water-rich rocky planets are usually calculated assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships, even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.1 times the insolation at Earth for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and would instead form a thick H\textsubscript{2}O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use a 1-D radiative-convective inverse version of the LMD generic numerical climate model to derive new theoretical mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. As a result of the runaway greenhouse radius inflation effect introduced in previous work, these new mass-radius relationships significantly differ from those traditionally used in the literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate -possibly by several orders of magnitude- their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08\%, respectively, assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show that significant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Broadly speaking, our results demonstrate that non-H\textsubscript{2}/He-dominated atmospheres can have a first-order effect on the mass-radius relationships, even for rocky planets receiving moderate irradiation. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H\textsubscript{2}O steam atmosphere thickness as a function of planet core gravity and radius, water content, and irradiation. This formula can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky planet (i.e., with any kind of interior composition ranging from pure iron to pure silicate) more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.},

TOI-1246 is one such system, with a moderately bright K dwarf (\$\textbackslash rm\{V=11.6,\textasciitilde K=9.9\}\$) and four transiting sub-Neptunes identified by TESS with orbital periods of \$4.31\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\},\textasciitilde 5.90\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\},\textasciitilde 18.66\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\}\$, and \$\textasciitilde 37.92\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\}\$. We collected 130 radial velocity observations with Keck/HIRES and TNG/HARPS-N to measure planet masses. We refit the 14 sectors of TESS photometry to refine planet radii (\$\textbackslash rm\{2.97 \textbackslash pm 0.06\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\},\textbackslash rm\{2.47 \textbackslash pm 0.08\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\}, \textbackslash rm\{3.46 \textbackslash pm 0.09\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{3.72 \textbackslash pm 0.16\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$), and confirm the four planets. We find that TOI-1246 e is substantially more massive than the three inner planets (\$\textbackslash rm\{8.1 \textbackslash pm 1.1 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{8.8 \textbackslash pm 1.2 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{5.3 \textbackslash pm 1.7 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{14.8 \textbackslash pm 2.3 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$). The two outer planets, TOI-1246 d and TOI-1246 e, lie near to the 2:1 resonance (\$\textbackslash rm\{P\_\{e\}/P\_\{d\}=2.03\}\$) and exhibit transit timing variations. TOI-1246 is one of the brightest four-planet systems, making it amenable for continued observations. It is one of only six systems with measured masses and radii for all four transiting planets. The planet densities range from \$\textbackslash rm\{0.70 \textbackslash pm 0.24\}\$ to \$3.21 \textbackslash pm 0.44 \textbackslash rm\{g/cm\^3\}\$, implying a range of bulk and atmospheric compositions. We also report a fifth planet candidate found in the RV data with a minimum mass of 25.6 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 3.6 \$\textbackslash rm\{M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$. This planet candidate is exterior to TOI-1246 e with a candidate period of 93.8 d, and we discuss the implications if it is confirmed to be planetary in nature.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) Surveys of protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) have provided important information on their demographics, but due to their sample sizes, they cannot be used to study how disk properties vary with the environment. We conduct a survey of the unresolved millimeter continuum emission of 873 protoplanetary disks identified by Spitzer in the L1641 and L1647 regions of the Orion A cloud. This is the largest such survey yet, allowing us to identify even weak trends in the median disk mass as a function of position in the cloud and cluster membership. The sample detection rates and median masses are also compared to those of nearby ({$<$}300 pc) SFRs. The sample was observed with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 0.08 mJy/beam (1.5 M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$). The data were reduced and imaged using an innovative parallel data processing approach. We detect 58\% (502/873) of the observed disks. This includes 20 disks with dust masses {$>$}100 M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$, and two objects associated with extended dust emission. We infer a median disk dust mass in the full sample of \$2.2\^\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$. In L1641 and L1647 median dust masses are \$2.1\^\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ and \$2.6\^\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.5\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$, respectively. The disk mass distribution of the full sample is similar to that of nearby low-mass SFRs at similar ages of 1-3 Myr. We find only weak trends in disk (dust) masses with galactic longitude and between the YSO clusters identified in the sample, with median masses varying by \$\textbackslash lesssim\$ 50\%. Age differences may explain these median disk mass variations. Apart from this, disk masses are essentially constant at scales of \textasciitilde 100 pc. This also suggests that the majority of disks, even in different SFRs, are formed with similar initial masses and evolve at similar rates, assuming no external irradiation, with disk mass loss rates of \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-8\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$/yr.},

This capability might allow PLATO to detect changes in planetary system architecture with time, particularly because planetary scattering due to Lagrange instability may be triggered long after the system was formed. Here, we utilize previously published instability time-scale prescriptions to determine PLATO's capability to detect a trend of decreasing planet frequency with age for systems with equal- mass planets. For two-planet systems, our results demonstrate that PLATO may detect a trend for planet masses which are at least as massive as super-Earths. For systems with three or more planets, we link their initial compactness to potentially detectable frequency trends in order to aid future investigations when these populations will be better characterized.},

  abstract = {A major outstanding question regarding the formation of planetary systems is whether wide-orbit giant planets form differently than close-in giant planets. We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: (1) the relative mass function and (2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions and the detection limits on lower mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that (1) the companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a functional form of N {$\propto$} M-1.3{$\pm$}0.03, and consequently, (2) many of these systems likely host additional undetected substellar companions. Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets.},

We compared the stellar and planetary properties of the multis and singles in a homogenous subset of the full CKS-Gaia catalog. We found that sub-Neptune sized singles and multis do not differ in their stellar properties or planet radii. In particular: (1.) The distributions of stellar properties \$M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$, [Fe/H], and \$v\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{sin\}i\$ for the Kepler sub Neptune-sized singles and multis are statistically indistinguishable. (2.) The radius distributions of the sub-Neptune sized singles and multis with \$P \textbackslash textgreater 3\$ days are indistinguishable, and both have a valley at \$\textbackslash backslashsim1.8{$\sim$}R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. However, there are significantly more detected short-period (\$P \textbackslash textless 3\$ days), sub-Neptune sized singles than multis. The similarity of the host star properties, planet radii, and radius valley for singles and multis suggests a common origin. The similar radius valley, which is likely sculpted by photo-evaporation from the host star within the first 100 Myr, suggests that planets in both singles and multis spend much of the first 100 Myr near their present, close-in locations. One explanation that is consistent with the similar fundamental properties of singles and multis is that many of the singles are members of multi-planet systems that underwent planet-planet scattering.},

This chapter explores the architectures of these planetary systems, which often display a remarkable degree of uniformity: the planets have nearly equal sizes, regular orbital spacing, low eccentricities, and small mutual inclinations. This uniformity stands in sharp contrast to the diverse nature of the exoplanet sample considered as a whole (as well as our inner solar system). We begin with a critical review of the observations -- including possible biases -- and find that these peas-in-a-pod planetary systems are apparently a common outcome of the planet formation process. Modest departures from exact uniformity suggest additional patterns, such as the planet mass slowly increasing with semi-major axis. The star formation process naturally produces circumstellar disks with the properties required to produce these planetary systems, although the solid material must move inward from its initial location. We discuss primary modes of planetary assembly, the role of orbital migration, and post-nebular atmospheric loss. Mature planetary systems are found to be near their minimum energy (tidal equilibrium) configurations; this finding provides a partial explanation for their observed properties and indicates that efficient energy dissipation must occur. Finally, we consider population synthesis models and show that peas-in-a-pod patterns emerge with reasonable choices for the input parameters. Nonetheless, interesting observational and theoretical challenges remain in order to understand how these surprisingly organized planetary systems arise from the disorder of their formation processes.},

However, owing to the large planet-to-star radius ratio, these planets are highly suitable for atmospheric study via transmission spectroscopy in the infrared, such as with JWST.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here we report the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune orbiting the thick-disk, mid-M dwarf star TOI-2406. The star's low metallicity and the relatively large size and short period of the planet make TOI-2406 b an unusual outcome of planet formation, and its characterisation provides an important observational constraint for formation models.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We first infer properties of the host star by analysing the star's near-infrared spectrum, spectral energy distribution, and \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} parallax. We use multi-band photometry to confirm that the transit event is on-target and achromatic, and we statistically validate the TESS signal as a transiting exoplanet. We then determine physical properties of the planet through global transit modelling of the TESS and ground-based time-series data.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We determine the host to be a metal-poor M4 V star, located at a distance of 56 pc, with properties \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3100 {$\pm$} 75 K, \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{*{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.162 {$\pm$} 0.008\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{*{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.202 {$\pm$} 0.011\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, and [Fe/H] = -0.38 {$\pm$} 0.07, and a member of the thick disk.

The system warrants further study, in particular radial velocity follow-up to determine the planet mass and constrain possible bound companions. Furthermore, TOI-2406 b is a good target for future atmospheric study through transmission spectroscopy. Although the planet's mass remains to be constrained, we estimate the S/N using amass-radius relationship, ranking the system fifth in the population of large sub-Neptunes, with TOI-2406 b having a much lower equilibrium temperature than other spectroscopically accessible members of this population.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Adsorption/desorption cycles utilizing a packed bed of a sorbent material made of diamine-functionalized commercial silica gel are performed under equilibrium and non-equilibrium (short-cycle) conditions. Thereby, the CO2 capture capacity of the material is determined over a wide range of operational parameters, namely 10\textendash 150 mbarabs desorption pressure, 74\textendash 90 \textdegree C desorption temperature, and 0\textendash 80\% relative humidity during adsorption. Up to 158 ml of CO2 (6.8 ml per gram sorbent) with a purity of up to 97.6\% is recovered per cycle. Adsorption isotherms of the sorbent material are experimentally determined by thermogravimetry and fitted to isotherm models, which are successfully applied to predict desorption capacities achieved in the TVS process. Under dry conditions, desorption pressures above 100 mbarabs lead to strongly decreasing CO2 capture capacities below 0.03 mmol g-1. Under humid conditions with 40\% relative humidity during adsorption, the desorption pressure can be raised to 150 mbarabs with capture capacities remaining above 0.2 mmol g-1. Stable performance of the sorbent material in the TVS process is demonstrated over 40 consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles.},

After conducting 600 simulations of planet formation followed by simulated Kepler observations, we instead propose that the apparent dichotomy reflects a divergence in the amount of migration and the separation of planetary semimajor axes into distinct "clusters". We find that our simulated high-mass systems migrate rapidly, bringing more planets into orbital periods of less than 200 days. The outer planets are often caught in a migration trap -- a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant co-rotation torque prevents inward migration -- which splits the system into two clusters. If clusters are sufficiently separated, the inner cluster remains dynamically cold, leading to low mutual inclinations and a higher probability of detecting multiple transiting planets. Conversely, our simulated low-mass systems typically bring fewer planets inside 200 days, forming a single cluster that quickly becomes dynamically unstable, leading to collisions and high mutual inclinations. We propose an alternative explanation for the apparent Kepler dichotomy in which migration traps during formation lead to fewer planets inside the Kepler detection window, and where mutual inclinations play only a secondary role. If our scenario is correct, then Kepler's STIPs (Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets) are a sample of planets that escaped capture by co-rotation traps, and their sizes may be a valuable probe into the structure of protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {The advent of the laser-frequency comb as the wavelength calibration unit allows us to measure the radial velocity (RV) at cm\,s-1 precision level with high stability in the long term, which enables the possibility of the detection of Earth twins around solar-like stars. A recent study shows that the laser-frequency comb can also be used to measure and study the precision of the instrumental system including the variations of line profile and the systematic uncertainty and instrumental drift. In this paper, we present the stringent analysis of a laser-frequency comb (LFC) system with 25\,GHz repetition frequency on an R {$\sim$} 50\,000 spectrograph with the wavelength spanning from 5085\textendash 7380 \AA. We report a novel fitting model optimized for the comb line profile, the constrained double Gaussian. The constraint condition is set as \$\textbackslash left|\textbackslash mu \_\{1,2\} - \textbackslash mu \textbackslash right| \textbackslash lt \textbackslash sqrt\{2\textbackslash ln2\}\textbackslash sigma\$. We introduce a Bayesian information criterion to test various models. Compared to the traditional Gaussian model, the CDG (constrained double Gaussian) model provides a much better goodness of fit. We apply the CDG model to the observed comb data to demonstrate the improvement of the RV precision with the CDG model. We find that the improvement of the CDG model is about 40\textendash 60~per\,cent for wavelength calibration precision. We also consider the use of the LFC and CDG model as a tool to characterize the line-shape variation across the detector. The aim of this work is to measure and understand the details of the comb lines including their asymmetry and behaviours under various conditions, which play a significant role in the simultaneous calibration process and cross-correlation function method to determine the Doppler shift at high precision level.},

We find that cold Jupiters appear three times more often around hosts of super Earths than they do around field stars. Given the prevalence of the super Earth systems, their cold Jupiters can account for nearly all cold Jupiters. In other words, cold Jupiters are almost certainly (\$\textbackslash backslashsim90\textbackslash backslash\%\$) companied by super Earths. A few corollaries follow: (1) around metal-rich ([Fe/H]\$\textbackslash textgreater0.1\$) stars, the fraction of super Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to \$60\textbackslash backslash\%\$ or higher; (2) the inner architecture can be strongly impacted by the outer giant and we report some observational evidence for this; (3) planetary systems like our own, with cold Jupiters but no super Earths, should be rare (\$\textbackslash backslashsim1\textbackslash backslash\%\$). The strong correlation between super Earths and cold Jupiters establish that super Earths and cold Jupiters do not compete for solid material, rather, they share similar origins, with the cold Jupiter formation requiring a somewhat more stringent condition. Lastly, we propose a few immediate observational tests of our results, using ground-based RV observations and ongoing/planned space missions.},

  abstract = {Lava worlds belong to a class of short orbital period planets reaching dayside temperatures high enough to melt their silicate crust. Theory predicts that the resulting lava oceans outgas their volatile components, attaining equilibrium with the overlying vapour. This creates a tenuous, silicate-rich atmosphere that may be confined to the permanent dayside of the planet. The launch of JWST will provide the much needed sensitivity and spectral coverage to characterise these worlds. In this paper, we assess the observability of characterisable spectral features by self-consistently modelling silicate atmospheres for all the currently confirmed targets having sufficient substellar temperatures ({$>$} 1500 K). To achieve this we use outgassed equilibrium chemistry and radiative transfer methods to compute temperature-pressure profiles, atmospheric chemical compositions and emission spectra. We explore varying melt compositions, free of highly-volatile elements, accounting for possible atmospheric evolution. Our models include a large number of neutral and ionic species, as well as all up-to-date opacities. The results indicate that SiO and SiO2 infrared features are the best, unique identifiers of silicate atmospheres, detectable using MIRI instrument of JWST. Detection of these two species in emission would allow for strong constraints on atmospheric thermal structure and possibly the composition of the melt. We also propose that certain species, e.g., TiO, may be directly tied to different classes of melts, possibly revealing surface and interior dynamics. Currently, there are nearly a dozen confirmed lava planets ideal for characterisation of silicate atmospheres using JWST, with two of these already accepted for the initial General Observers program.},
