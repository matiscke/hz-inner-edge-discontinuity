  abstract = {Abstract Due to impact degassing during accretion, a hot H2O-rich proto-atmosphere was possibly formed on the growing Earth. We investigate the evolution of an impact-generated H2O\textendash CO2 atmosphere at the final stage of accretion by using a one-dimensional radiative-convective atmosphere model. Since atmospheric pressure is high ({$\sim$}200 bar) and close to the critical point of water vapor (647 K, 220 bar), we need to take into account the nonideal behavior of gases in the calculation. It is shown that the surface temperature suddenly decreases when the impact (accretion) energy flux decreases to about 150 W m-2, and that a proto-ocean is formed on the growing Earth. The estimated temperature of a proto-ocean is consistent with that of an archaean ocean estimated from the oxygen isotope data.},

  abstract = {The first part of this paper discusses how planet formation proceeds in the disks orbiting M dwarf stars. These environments are different from those associated with solar-type stars in several ways: The planet forming clock (set by orbits) runs slower, the disks are more prone to evaporation, the supply of raw material is lower, the snowline is closer in, and planetary systems are more easily disrupted. Because of these considerations, red dwarfs are less likely to harbor giant planets, but can readily produce smaller planets. The second part of this paper describes stellar evolution calculations for M dwarfs, which live far longer than the current age of the universe. These diminutive stellar objects remain convective over most of their lives, continue to burn hydrogen for trillions of years, and do not experience red giant phases in their old age. Instead, red dwarfs turn into blue dwarfs and finally white dwarfs. This work also shows (in part) why larger stars become red giants. (\textcopyright{} 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

  abstract = {This paper constructs a theoretical framework for calculating the distribution of masses for gas giant planets forming via the core accretion paradigm. Starting with known properties of circumstellar disks, we present models for the planetary mass distribution over the range 0.1M J {$\leq$} M p {$<$} 10M J. If the circumstellar disk lifetime is solely responsible for the end of planetary mass accretion, the observed (nearly) exponential distribution of disk lifetime would imprint an exponential falloff in the planetary mass function. This result is in apparent conflict with observations, which suggest that the mass distribution has a (nearly) power-law form of , with an index of p {$\approx$} 1.3, over the relevant planetary mass range (and for stellar masses {$\sim$}0.5\textendash 2M {$\odot$}). The mass accretion rate onto the planet depends on the fraction of the (circumstellar) disk accretion flow that enters the Hill sphere, and on the efficiency with which the planet captures the incoming material. Models for the planetary mass function that include distributions for these efficiencies, with uninformed priors, can produce nearly power-law behavior, consistent with current observations. The disk lifetimes, accretion rates, and other input parameters depend on the mass of the host star. We show how these variations lead to different forms for the planetary mass function for different stellar masses. Compared to stars with masses M * = 0.5\textendash 2M {$\odot$}, stars with smaller masses are predicted to have a steeper planetary mass function (fewer large planets).},

Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity and comparative robustness, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such datasets. In this review we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modelling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain datasets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code, discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability, and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open source GP software packages. Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time domain astronomy for many years to come.},

Using nulling interferometry, LIFE will allow us to constrain the radius and effective temperature of (terrestrial) exoplanets, as well as provide unique information about their atmospheric structure and composition. We explore the potential of LIFE in characterizing emission spectra of Earth at various stages of its evolution. We perform Bayesian retrievals on simulated spectra of 8 different scenarios, which correspond to cloud-free and cloudy spectra of four different epochs of the evolution of the Earth. Assuming a distance of 10 pc and a Sun-like host star, we simulate observations obtained with LIFE using its simulator LIFEsim, considering all major astrophysical noise sources. With the nominal spectral resolution (R=50) and signal-to-noise ratio (assumed to be S/N=10 at 11.2 \$\textbackslash mu\$m), we can identify the main spectral features of all the analyzed scenarios (most notably CO\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, O\$\_3\$, CH\$\_4\$). This allows us to distinguish between inhabited and lifeless scenarios. Results suggest that particularly O\$\_3\$ and CH\$\_4\$ yield an improved abundance estimate by doubling the S/N from 10 to 20. We conclude that the baseline requirements for R and S/N are sufficient for LIFE to detect O\$\_3\$ and CH\$\_4\$ in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet with an abundance of O\$\_2\$ of around 2\% in volume mixing ratio. This information is relevant in terms of the LIFE mission planning. We also conclude that cloud-free retrievals of cloudy planets can be used to characterize the atmospheric composition of terrestrial habitable planets, but not the thermal structure of the atmosphere. From the inter-model comparison performed, we deduce that differences in the opacity tables (caused by e.g. a different line wing treatment) may be an important source of systematic errors.},

  abstract = {Recent surveys show that protoplanetary disks have lower levels of turbulence than expected based on their observed accretion rates. A viable solution to this is that magnetized disk winds dominate angular momentum transport. This has several important implications for planet formation processes. We compute the physical and chemical evolution of disks and the formation and migration of planets under the combined effects of angular momentum transport by turbulent viscosity and disk winds. We take into account the critical role of planet traps to limit Type I migration in all of these models and compute thousands of planet evolution tracks for single planets drawn from a distribution of initial disk properties and turbulence strengths. We do not consider multi-planet models nor include N-body planet-planet interactions. Within this physical framework we find that populations with a constant value disk turbulence and winds strength produce mass-semimajor axis distributions in the M-a diagram with insufficient scatter to compare reasonably with observations. However, populations produced as a consequence of sampling disks with a distribution of the relative strengths of disk turbulence and winds fit much better. Such models give rise to a substantial super Earth population at orbital radii 0.03-2 AU, as well as a clear separation between the produced hot Jupiter and warm Jupiter populations. Additionally, this model results in a good comparison with the exoplanetary mass-radius distribution in the M-R diagram after post-disk atmospheric photoevaporation is accounted for.},

  abstract = {In the general classical picture of pebble-based core growth, planetary cores grow by accretion of single pebble species. The growing planet may reach the so-called pebble isolation mass, at which it induces a pressure bump that blocks inward drifting pebbles exterior to its orbit, thereby stalling core growth by pebble accretion. In recent hydrodynamic simulations, pebble filtration by the pressure bump depends on several parameters including core mass, disc structure, turbulent viscosity and pebble size. We have investigated how accretion of multiple, instead of single, pebble species affects core growth rates, and how the dependence of pebble isolation mass on turbulent viscosity and pebble size sets the final core masses. We performed numerical simulations in a viscous one-dimensional disc, where maximal grain sizes were regulated by grain growth, fragmentation and drift limits. We confirm that core growth rates and final core masses are sensitive to three key parameters: the threshold velocity at which pebbles fragment on collision, the turbulent viscosity and the distribution of pebble species, which yield a diversity of planetary cores. With accretion of multiple pebble species, planetary cores can grow very fast, reaching over 30-40 ME in mass. Potential cores of cold gas giants were able to form from embryos initially implanted as far as 50 au. Our results suggest that accretion of multispecies pebbles could explain: the estimated 25-45 ME heavy element abundance inside Jupiter's core; the massive cores of extrasolar planets; the disc rings and gaps at wider orbits; and the early and rapid formation of planetary bodies.},

One system of particular interest is Kepler-1656, which hosts a sub-Jovian planet with an eccentricity of 0.8. Sufficiently eccentric orbits will shrink in the semimajor axis due to tidal dissipation of orbital energy during periastron passage. Here our goal was to assess whether Kepler-1656b is currently undergoing such high-eccentricity migration, and to further understand the system's origins and architecture. We confirm a second planet in the system with M c = 0.40 {$\pm$} 0.09 M jup and Pc = 1919 {$\pm$} 27 days. We simulated the dynamical evolution of planet b in the presence of planet c and find a variety of possible outcomes for the system, such as tidal migration and engulfment. The system is consistent with an in situ dynamical origin of planet b followed by subsequent eccentric Kozai-Lidov perturbations that excite Kepler-1656b's eccentricity gently, i.e., without initiating tidal migration. Thus, despite its high eccentricity, we find no evidence that planet b is or has migrated through the high-eccentricity channel. Finally, we predict the outer orbit to be mutually inclined in a nearly perpendicular configuration with respect to the inner planet orbit based on the outcomes of our simulations and make observable predictions for the inner planet's spin-orbit angle. Our methodology can be applied to other eccentric or tidally locked planets to constrain their origins, orbital configurations, and properties of a potential companion.},

While it has been detected in the Solar System's giant planets, it has not been observed in exoplanets yet. In the exoplanetary context however it has been theorized as a potential biosignature molecule. The goal of our study is to identify which illustrative science cases for PH3 chemistry are observable with a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometric observatory like the LIFE (Large Interferometer For Exoplanets) concept. We identified a representative set of scenarios for PH3 detections in exoplanetary atmospheres varying over the whole dynamic range of the LIFE mission. We used chemical kinetics and radiative transfer calculations to produce forward models of these informative, prototypical observational cases for LIFEsim, our observation simulator software for LIFE. In a detailed, yet first order approximation it takes a mission like LIFE: (i) about 1h to find phosphine in a warm giant around a G star at 10 pc, (ii) about 10 h in H2 or CO2 dominated temperate super-Earths around M star hosts at 5 pc, (iii) and even in 100h it seems very unlikely that phosphine would be detectable in a Venus-Twin with extreme PH3 concentrations at 5 pc. Phosphine in concentrations previously discussed in the literature is detectable in 2 out of the 3 cases and about an order of magnitude faster than comparable cases with JWST. We show that there is a significant number of objects accessible for these classes of observations. These results will be used to prioritize the parameter range for the next steps with more detailed retrieval simulations. They will also inform timely questions in the early design phase of a mission like LIFE and guide the community by providing easy-to-scale first estimates for a large part of detection space of such a mission.},

This goal requires a bold new generation of space telescopes, but even the most ambitious designs yet hope to characterize several dozen potentially habitable planets. Such a sample may be too small to truly understand the complexity of exo-earths. We describe here a notional concept for a novel space observatory designed to characterize 1000 transiting exo-earth candidates. The Nautilus concept is based on an array of inflatable spacecraft carrying very large diameter (8.5 m), very low weight, multiorder diffractive optical elements (MODE lenses) as light-collecting elements. The mirrors typical to current space telescopes are replaced by MODE lenses with a 10 times lighter areal density that are 100 times less sensitive to misalignments, enabling lightweight structure. MODE lenses can be cost-effectively replicated through molding. The Nautilus mission concept has a potential to greatly reduce fabrication and launch costs and mission risks compared to the current space telescope paradigm through replicated components and identical, lightweight unit telescopes. Nautilus is designed to survey transiting exo-earths for biosignatures up to a distance of 300 pc, enabling a rigorous statistical exploration of the frequency and properties of life-bearing planets and the diversity of exo-earths.},

  abstract = {Exoplanets observed by the Kepler telescope exhibit a bimodal, radius distribution, which is known as the radius gap. We explore an origin of the radius gap, focusing on multiplanet systems. Our simple theoretical argument predicts that type I planetary migration produces different configurations of protoplanets with different masses and such different configurations can result in two distinguishable populations of small-sized multiplanet systems. We then perform an observational analysis to verify this prediction. In the analysis, multiple Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are applied to the observed systems, using the statistical measures that are devised to systematically characterize the properties of multiplanet systems. We find with 99.5\% confidence that the observed, small-sized multiplanet systems are divided into two distinct populations. The distinction likely originates from different spatial distributions of protoplanets, which are determined by type I migration and subsequently trigger giant impact. We also show that these distinct populations are separated around the radius gap when the gas surface density of protoplanetary disks is \textasciitilde 102 g cm-2 in the vicinity of the host stars. This work therefore emphasizes the importance of planetary migration and the inner disk properties.},

In the present review, we discuss selected examples in these areas in a combined analysis of the state-of-the-art of synthetic methodologies and processes with their life cycle assessment. Thereby, we attempted to assess the potential to reduce the environmental footprint in these application fields relative to the current petrochemical value chain. This analysis and discussion differs significantly from a viewpoint on CO2 utilization as a measure for global CO2 mitigation. Whereas the latter focuses on reducing the end-of-pipe problem ``CO2 emissions'' from todays' industries, the approach taken here tries to identify opportunities by exploiting a novel feedstock that avoids the utilization of fossil resource in transition toward more sustainable future production. Thus, the motivation to develop CO2-based chemistry does not depend primarily on the absolute amount of CO2 emissions that can be remediated by a single technology. Rather, CO2-based chemistry is stimulated by the significance of the relative improvement in carbon balance and other critical factors defining the environmental impact of chemical production in all relevant sectors in accord with the principles of green chemistry.},

  abstract = {Context. The orbital distribution of exoplanets indicates an accumulation of super-Earth sized planets close to their host stars in compact systems. When an inward disc-driven migration scenario is assumed for their formation, these planets could have been stopped and might have been parked at an inner edge of the disc, or be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a resonant chain. This topic has not been properly and extensively studied. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the possibility that the inner planets in a resonant chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by outer planets. We performed hydrodynamical and N-body simulations of planetary systems embedded in their nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc was represented in two different ways, resembling either a dead zone inner edge (DZ) or a disc inner boundary (IB). The main difference lies in the steepness of the surface density profile. The innermost planet always has a mass of 10 M Earth , with additional outer planets of equal or higher mass. A steeper profile is able to stop a chain of planets more efficiently than a shallower profile. The final configurations in our DZ models are usually tighter than in their IB counterparts, and therefore more prone to instability. We derive analytical expressions for the stopping conditions based on power equilibrium, and show that the final eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For planets in thinner discs, we found, for the first time, clear signs for over-stable librations in the hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact systems. We also found that the popular N-body simulations may overestimate the number of planets in the disc inner cavity.},

This is the major breakthrough in studies of protoplanetary disks since Protostars and Planets VI and is reshaping the field of planet formation. However, while the capability of imaging substructures in protoplanetary disks has been steadily improving, the origin of many substructures are still largely debated. The structured distributions of gas and solids in protoplanetary disks likely reflect the outcome of physical processes at work, including the formation of planets. Yet, the diverse properties among the observed protoplanetary disk population, for example, the number and radial location of rings and gaps in the dust distribution, suggest that the controlling process may differ between disks and/or the outcome may be sensitive to stellar or disk properties. In this review, we (1) summarize the existing observations of protoplanetary disk substructures collected from the literature; (2) provide a comprehensive theoretical review of various processes proposed to explain observed protoplanetary disk substructures; (3) compare current theoretical predictions with existing observations and highlight future research directions to distinguish between different origins; and (4) discuss implications of state-of-the-art protoplanetary disk observations to protoplanetary disk and planet formation theory.},

  abstract = {Giant planets have been discovered at large separations from the central star. Moreover, a striking number of young circumstellar disks have gas and/or dust gaps at large orbital separations, potentially driven by embedded planetary objects. To form massive planets at large orbital separations through core accretion within disk lifetime, however, an early solid body to seed pebble and gas accretion is desirable. Young protoplanetary disks are likely self-gravitating, and these gravitoturbulent disks may efficiently concentrate solid material at the midplane driven by spiral waves. We run 3D local hydrodynamical simulations of gravitoturbulent disks with Lagrangian dust particles to determine whether particle and gas self-gravity can lead to the formation of dense solid bodies, seeding later planet formation. When self-gravity between dust particles is included, solids of size \$\textbackslash mathrm\{St\} = 0.1\$ to \$1\$ concentrate within the gravitoturbulent spiral features and collapse under their own self-gravity into dense clumps up to several \$M\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ in mass at wide orbits. Simulations with dust that drift most efficiently, \$\textbackslash mathrm\{St\}=1\$, form the most massive clouds of particles, while simulations with smaller dust particles, \$\textbackslash mathrm\{St\}=0.1\$, have clumps with masses an order of magnitude lower. When the effect of dust backreaction onto the gas is included, dust clumps become smaller by a factor of a few but more numerous. The existence of large solid bodies at an early stage of the disk can accelerate the planet formation process, particularly at wide orbital separations, and potentially explain planets distant from the central stars and young protoplanetary disks with substructures.},

Further evidence hints that this distribution may evolve on very short time-scales, specifically of the order of a rotation period or less. In an attempt to study this behaviour in more detail, we have carried out a pilot programme to monitor three L dwarfs in the near-infrared where these objects are significantly brighter than at shorter wavelengths. We present a robust data analysis method for improving the precision and reliability of infrared photometry. No significant variability was detected in either the J or K{${'}$} bands in 2M1439 and SDSS1203 above a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.04 mag (0.08 mag for 2M1112). The main limiting factor in achieving lower detection limits is suspected to be second-order extinction effects in the atmosphere of the Earth, on account of the very different colours of the target and reference stars. Suggestions are given for overcoming such effects, which should improve the sensitivity and reliability of infrared variability searches.},

  abstract = {The architecture of a planetary system can influence the habitability of a planet via orbital effects, particularly in the areas of stability and eccentricity. Some of these effects are readily apparent, particularly when they occur on short timescales that are easily numerically calculable. However, the appearance and evolution of life can take place on gigayear timescales, long enough that secular effects become important. These effects are difficult to investigate, as a direct integration requires significant computational time. In this paper, we apply a semi-analytic framework in conjunction with N-body integrations and predictive techniques to determine the relative habitability for an Earth-like planet in a system with two giant companions over a multidimensional parameter space. Relative habitability quantifies the integrated habitability probability compared to a system containing only a single Earth-like planet. We find trends with mass, eccentricity, location, spacing, inclination, and alignment of the giant planets, including configurations where the system is more habitable due to the giant planets. As long as the system remains stable, a moderate eccentricity excitation of the terrestrial planet can be beneficial by increasing the outer boundary of the habitable zone through higher mean irradiance. In our simulations, the median (\$\textbackslash pm 1 \textbackslash sigma\$) habitable planet has an eccentricity of 0.11 (+0.16, -0.08), though it started circular. Low-mass, widely separated, and moderately eccentric perturbing giants can accomplish this, an "ultra-habitable" configuration of companions.},

The mass-M\_V and mass-M\_K relations are in excellent agreement with the empirical relations derived observationally. The theoretical color-magnitude diagrams are compared with the sequences of globular clusters (47 Tucanae) and open clusters (NGC2420 and NGC2477) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Comparison is also made with field star sequences in M\_V-(V-I), M\_K-(I-K) and M\_K-(J-K) diagrams. These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below T\_eff \textasciitilde{} 3700K, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude.

Here, we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, the physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-minute cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250 {$\pm$} 70 exoplanets (90\% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 R{$\oplus$}. Furthermore, we predict that an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 R{$\oplus$} with mass measurements.

However, all the other metal ions exist at much lower concentrations. This paper reports an estimate of the feasibility of the extraction of these metal ions on the basis of the energy needed. In most cases, the result is that extraction in amounts comparable to the present production from land mines would be impossible because of the very large amount of energy needed. This conclusion holds also for uranium as fuel for the present generation of nuclear fission plants. Nevertheless, in a few cases, mainly lithium, extraction from seawater could provide amounts of metals sufficient for closing the cycle of metal use in the economy, provided that an increased level of recycling can be attained.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, stellar radiation has been the only heat source considered capable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here, we show that terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high-enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long-enough duration for all the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and cannot support life. We call these planets ``Tidal Venuses'' and the phenomenon a ``tidal greenhouse.'' Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle into nearly circular orbits (i.e., with negligible tidal heating) in the habitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable, as past tidal heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. We simulated the evolution of hypothetical planetary systems in a quasi-continuous parameter distribution and found that we could constrain the history of the system by statistical arguments. Planets orbiting stars with masses{$<$}0.3 MSun may be in danger of desiccation via tidal heating. We have applied these concepts to Gl 667C c, a {$\sim$}4.5 MEarth planet orbiting a 0.3 MSun star at 0.12 AU. We found that it probably did not lose its water via tidal heating, as orbital stability is unlikely for the high eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation, our results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for noncircular orbits. In the appendices we review (a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, (b) hydrogen escape, (c) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, (d) terrestrial planet mass-radius relations, and (e) linear tidal theories.

  abstract = {We describe a software package called VPLanet that simulates fundamental aspects of planetary system evolution over Gyr timescales, with a focus on investigating habitable worlds. In this initial release, eleven physics modules are included that model internal, atmospheric, rotational, orbital, stellar, and galactic processes. Many of these modules can be coupled to simultaneously simulate the evolution of terrestrial planets, gaseous planets, and stars. The code is validated by reproducing a selection of observations and past results. VPLanet is written in C and designed so that the user can choose the physics modules to apply to an individual object at runtime without recompiling, i.e., a single executable can simulate the diverse phenomena that are relevant to a wide range of planetary and stellar systems. This feature is enabled by matrices and vectors of function pointers that are dynamically allocated and populated based on user input. The speed and modularity of VPLanet enables large parameter sweeps and the versatility to add/remove physical phenomena to assess their importance. VPLanet is publicly available from a repository that contains extensive documentation, numerous examples, Python scripts for plotting and data management, and infrastructure for community input and future development.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of weight percent of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. To understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma-ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present , a versatile magma-ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma-ocean atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth oceans. We also reanalyze the structures of these planets and find they have water mass fractions of 0\textendash 0.23, 0.01\textendash 0.21, and 0.11\textendash 0.24 for planets e, f, and g, respectively. Our model does not make a strong prediction about the water and oxygen content of the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 e at the time of mantle solidification. In contrast, the model predicts that TRAPPIST-1 f and g would have a thick steam atmosphere with a small amount of oxygen at that stage. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3\textendash 5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

  abstract = {e Eridani, the fifth-closest Sun-like star, hosts at least three planets and could possibly harbor more. However, the veracity of the planet candidates in the system and its full planetary architecture remain unknown. Here we analyze the planetary architecture of e Eridani via DYNAMITE, a method providing an integrative assessment of the system architecture (and possibly yet-undetected planets) by combining statistical, exoplanet-population level knowledge with incomplete but specific information available on the system. DYNAMITE predicts the most likely location of an additional planet in the system based on the Kepler population demographic information from more than 2000 planets. Additionally, we analyze the dynamical stability of e Eridani system via N-body simulations. Our DYNAMITE and dynamical stability analyses provide support for planet candidates g, c, and f, and also predict one additional planet candidate with an orbital period between 549 -- 733 days, in the habitable zone of the system. We find that planet candidate f, if it exists, would also lie in the habitable zone. Our dynamical stability analysis also shows that the e Eridani planetary eccentricities, as reported, do not allow for a stable system, suggesting that they are lower. We introduce a new statistical approach for estimating the equilibrium and surface temperatures of exoplanets, based on a prior on the planetary albedo distribution. e Eridani is a rich planetary system with a possibility of containing two potentially habitable planets, and its vicinity to our Solar System makes it an important target for future imaging studies and biosignature searches.},

We show that under conditions appropriate to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, rapid gas accretion can be initiated by super-Earth-type planets, comprising 10\textendash 20 Earth masses of refractory material. An in situ formation scenario leads to testable consequences, including the expectation that hot Jupiters should frequently be accompanied by additional low-mass planets with periods shorter than {$\sim$}100 days. Our calculations further demonstrate that dynamical interactions during the early stages of planetary systems' lifetimes should increase the inclinations of such companions, rendering transits rare. High-precision radial velocity monitoring provides the best prospect for their detection.},

NGTS-1b is the third transiting giant planet found around an M-dwarf, reinforcing the notion that close-in gas giants can form and migrate similar to the known population of hot Jupiters around solar-type stars. The host star shows no signs of activity, and the kinematics hint at the star being from the thick disc population. With a deep (2.5\,per\,cent) transit around a K~=~11.9 host, NGTS-1b will be a strong candidate to probe giant planet composition around M-dwarfs via James Webb Space Telescope transmission spectroscopy.},

Nevertheless, the high cost of building facilities that can address this topic and the keen public interest in the results of such research requires rigorous development of experiments that can deliver a definitive advancement in our understanding. Most work to date in this area has focused on a ``systems science'' approach of obtaining and interpreting comprehensive data for individual planets to make statements about their habitability and the possibility that they harbor life. This strategy is challenging because of the diversity of exoplanets, both observed and expected, and the limited information that can be obtained with astronomical instruments. Here, we propose a complementary approach that is based on performing surveys of key planetary characteristics and using statistical marginalization to answer broader questions than can be addressed with a small sample of objects. The fundamental principle of this comparative planetology approach is maximizing what can be learned from each type of measurement by applying it widely rather than requiring that multiple kinds of observations be brought to bear on a single object. As a proof of concept, we outline a survey of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric water and carbon dioxide abundances that would test the habitable zone hypothesis and lead to a deeper understanding of the frequency of habitable planets. We also discuss ideas for additional surveys that could be developed to test other foundational hypotheses in this area.},

  abstract = {Planets intermediate in size between the Earth and Neptune, and orbiting closer to their host stars than Mercury does the Sun, are the most common type of planet revealed by exoplanet surveys over the last quarter century. Results from NASA's Kepler mission have revealed a bimodality in the radius distribution of these objects, with a relative underabundance of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. This bimodality suggests that sub-Neptunes are mostly rocky planets that were born with primary atmospheres a few percent by mass accreted from the protoplanetary nebula. Planets above the radius gap were able to retain their atmospheres ("gas-rich super-Earths"), while planets below the radius gap lost their atmospheres and are stripped cores ("true super-Earths"). The mechanism that drives atmospheric loss for these planets remains an outstanding question, with photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss being the prime candidates. As with the mass-loss mechanism, there are two contenders for the origins of the solids in sub-Neptune planets: the migration model involves the growth and migration of embryos from beyond the ice line, while the drift model involves inward-drifting pebbles that coagulate to form planets close-in. Atmospheric studies have the potential to break degeneracies in interior structure models and place additional constraints on the origins of these planets. However, most atmospheric characterization efforts have been confounded by aerosols. Observations with upcoming facilities are expected to finally reveal the atmospheric compositions of these worlds, which are arguably the first fundamentally new type of planetary object identified from the study of exoplanets.},

The expected photometric precision will also allow CHEOPS to go beyond measuring only transits and to follow phase curves or to search for exo-moons, for example. Finally, by unveiling transiting exoplanets with high potential for in-depth characterisation, CHEOPS will also provide prime targets for future instruments suited to the spectroscopic characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. To reach its science objectives, requirements on the photometric precision and stability have been derived for stars with magnitudes ranging from 6 to 12 in the V band. In particular, CHEOPS shall be able to detect Earth-size planets transiting G5 dwarf stars (stellar radius of 0.9R{$\odot$}) in the magnitude range 6 {$\leq$} V {$\leq$}\,9 by achieving a photometric precision of 20 ppm in 6 hours of integration time. In the case of K-type stars (stellar radius of 0.7R{$\odot$}) of magnitude in the range 9 {$\leq$} V {$\leq$}\,12, CHEOPS shall be able to detect transiting Neptune-size planets achieving a photometric precision of 85 ppm in 3 hours of integration time. This precision has to be maintained over continuous periods of observation for up to 48 hours. This precision and stability will be achieved by using a single, frame-transfer, back-illuminated CCD detector at the focal plane assembly of a 33.5 cm diameter, on-axis Ritchey-Chr\'etien telescope. The nearly 275 kg spacecraft is nadir-locked, with a pointing accuracy of about 1 arcsec rms, and will allow for at least 1 Gbit/day downlink. The sun-synchronous dusk-dawn orbit at 700 km altitude enables having the Sun permanently on the backside of the spacecraft thus minimising Earth stray light. A mission duration of 3.5 years in orbit is foreseen to enable the execution of the science programme. During this period, 20\% of the observing time is available to the wider community through yearly ESA call for proposals, as well as through discretionary time approved by ESA's Director of Science. At the time of this writing, CHEOPS commissioning has been completed and CHEOPS has been shown to fulfill all its requirements. The mission has now started the execution of its science programme.},

  abstract = {The dearth of planets with sizes around 1.8 \$\textbackslash mathrm\{R\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$ is a key demographic feature discovered by the \$Kepler\$ mission. Two theories have emerged as potential explanations for this valley: photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss. However, Rogers et al. (2021) shows that differentiating between the two theories is possible using the three-dimensional parameter space of planet radius, incident flux, and stellar mass. We use homogeneously-derived stellar and planetary parameters to measure the \$Kepler\$ exoplanet radius gap in this three-dimensional space. We compute the slope of the gap as a function of incident flux at constant stellar mass (\$\textbackslash alpha\$ \$\textbackslash equiv\$ \$\textbackslash left(\textbackslash partial \textbackslash log R\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{gap\}\} / \textbackslash partial \textbackslash log S \textbackslash right)\_\{M\_\textbackslash star\}\$) and the slope of the gap as a function of stellar mass at constant incident flux (\$\textbackslash beta\$ \$\textbackslash equiv\$ \$\textbackslash left(\textbackslash partial \textbackslash log R\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{gap\}\} / \textbackslash partial \textbackslash log M\_\textbackslash star \textbackslash right)\_\{S\}\$) and find \$\textbackslash alpha\$ = 0.069\$\^\{+0.019\}\_\{-0.023\}\$ and \$\textbackslash beta\$ = \$-\$0.046\$\^\{+0.125\}\_\{-0.117\}\$. Given that Rogers et al. (2021) shows that core-powered mass-loss predicts \$\textbackslash alpha\$ \$\textbackslash approx\$ 0.08 and \$\textbackslash beta\$ \$\textbackslash approx\$ 0.00 while photoevaporation predicts \$\textbackslash alpha\$ \$\textbackslash approx\$ 0.12 and \$\textbackslash beta\$ \$\textbackslash approx\$ --0.17, our measurements are more consistent with core-powered mass-loss than photoevaporation. However, we caution that different gap-determination methods can produce systematic offsets in both \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and \$\textbackslash beta\$; therefore, we motivate a comprehensive re-analysis of \$Kepler\$ light curves with modern, updated priors on eccentricity and mean stellar density to improve both the accuracy and precision of planet radii and subsequent measurements of the gap.},

  abstract = {New ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks allow us to probe planet formation in other planetary systems, giving us new constraints on planet formation processes. Meanwhile, studies of our own Solar System rely on constraints derived in a completely different way. However, it is still unclear what features the Solar System protoplanetary disk could have produced during its gas phase. By running 2D isothermal hydro-simulations used as inputs for a dust evolution model, we derive synthetic images at millimeter wavelengths using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the radial gas velocities of the disk. These velocity perturbations create traffic jams in the dust, producing over-densities different from the ones created by pressure traps and located away from the planets' positions in the disk. By deriving the images at \emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$} = 1.3 mm from these dust distributions, we show that very high resolution observations are needed to distinguish the most important features expected in the inner part ({$<$}15 AU) of the disk. The traffic jams, observable with a high resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and rings in disks and the number of embedded planets. We additionally show that a system capable of producing eccentric planets by scattering events that match the eccentricity distributions in observed exoplanets does not automatically produce bright outer rings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations of disks of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant planet formation scenarios during the disk phase, where the giants form either in the outer regions of the disks or in the inner regions. In the second scenario, the disks do not present planet-related features at large radii. Finally, we find that, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently, the dust masses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared to the dust contained in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick regions. Our study clearly shows that in addition to the constraints from exoplanets and the Solar System, ALMA has the power to constrain different stages of planet formation already during the first few million years, which corresponds to the gas disk phase.}},

  abstract = {In the effort to characterize the masses, radii, and atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets, there is an urgent need to find examples of such planets transiting nearby M dwarfs. The MEarth Project is an ongoing effort to do so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect exoplanets as small as 2 R{$\oplus$} transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in photometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability that is common among these stars and by the nocturnal cadence, atmospheric variations, and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound observatories. Here, we summarize the properties of MEarth data gathered so far, emphasizing the challenges they present for transit detection. We address these challenges with a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits in wiggly and irregularly spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods that clean trends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses the significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling variability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our Method for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability of a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian approach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters of this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters into its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual transits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates and compare our results to the popular box-fitting least-squares method with simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth Project, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing the false alarm probability of transit signals in real data.},

In its first four years, MEarth discovered one transiting exoplanet, the 2.7 R{$\oplus$} planet GJ1214b. Here, we answer an outstanding question: in light of the bounty of small planets transiting small stars uncovered by the Kepler mission, should MEarth have found more than just one planet so far? We estimate MEarth's ensemble sensitivity to exoplanets by performing end-to-end simulations of 1.25 \texttimes{} 106 observations of 988 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs, gathered by MEarth between 2008 October and 2012 June. For 2\textendash 4 R{$\oplus$} planets, we compare this sensitivity to results from Kepler and find that MEarth should have found planets at a rate of 0.05\textendash 0.36 planets yr-1 in its first four years. As part of this analysis, we provide new analytic fits to the Kepler early M dwarf planet occurrence distribution. When extrapolating between Kepler's early M dwarfs and MEarth's mid-to-late M dwarfs, we find that assuming the planet occurrence distribution stays fixed with respect to planetary equilibrium temperature provides a good match to our detection of a planet with GJ1214b's observed properties. For larger planets, we find that the warm (600\textendash 700 K), Neptune-sized (4 R{$\oplus$}) exoplanets that transit early M dwarfs like Gl436 and GJ3470 occur at a rate of {$<$}0.15 star-1 (at 95\% confidence) around MEarth's later M dwarf targets. We describe a strategy with which MEarth can increase its expected planet yield by 2.5 \texttimes{} without new telescopes by shifting its sensitivity toward the smaller and cooler exoplanets that Kepler has demonstrated to be abundant.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have found a valley in the size distribution of close-in super-Earths that is interpreted as a signpost that close-in super-Earths are mostly rocky in composition. However, new models predict that planetesimals should first form at the water ice line such that close-in planets are expected to have a significant water ice component. Here we investigate the water contents of super-Earths by studying the interplay between pebble accretion, planet migration and disc evolution. Planets' compositions are determined by their position relative to different condensation fronts (ice lines) throughout their growth. Migration plays a key role. Assuming that planetesimals start at or exterior to the water ice line ( ), inward migration causes planets to leave the source region of icy pebbles and therefore to have lower final water contents than in discs with either outward migration or no migration. The water ice line itself moves inward as the disc evolves, and delivers water as it sweeps across planets that formed dry. The relative speed and direction of planet migration and inward drift of the water ice line is thus central in determining planets' water contents. If planet formation starts at the water ice line, this implies that hot close-in super-Earths (\emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.3 AU) with water contents of a few percent are a signpost of inward planet migration during the early gas phase. Hot super-Earths with larger water ice contents on the other hand, experienced outward migration at the water ice line and only migrated inwards after their formation was complete either because they become too massive to be contained in the region of outward migration or in chains of resonant planets. Measuring the water ice content of hot super-Earths may thus constrain their migration history.}},

To maximize the efficiency of follow-up observations, a prioritization scheme must be developed to determine which planets are most likely to be EECs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for estimating the likelihood that any directly imaged extrasolar planet is a true EEC by interpreting the planet's apparent magnitude and separation in the context of existing exoplanet statistics. As a specific application of this general framework, we use published estimates of the discovery yield of future space-based direct-imaging mission concepts to conduct ``mock surveys'' in which we compute the likelihood that each detected planet is an EEC. We find that it will be difficult to determine which planets are EECs with {$>$}50\% confidence using single-band photometry immediately upon their detection. The best way to reduce this ambiguity would be to constrain the orbit of a given planet by revisiting the system multiple times or through a radial velocity precursor survey. Astrometric or radial velocity constraints on the mass of the planet would offer a lesser benefit. Finally, we show that a Bayesian approach to prioritizing targets would improve the follow-up efficiency of a direct imaging survey versus a blind approach using the same data. For example, the prioritized approach could reduce the amount of integration time required for the spectral detection (or rejection) of water absorption in most EECs by a factor of two.},

We demonstrate that next-generation space observatories currently under consideration could test this hypothesis, but only if the stellar age distribution of the target sample is carefully considered. We explore three possible parameterizations of the age-oxygen correlation, finding that they yield similar results. Finally, we examine how abiotic oxygen sources could affect the results, and discuss how measuring the age dependence of oxygen could shed light on whether it is a reliable biosignature. Future efforts can expand upon this groundwork by incorporating detailed models of the redox balance of terrestrial planets and its dependence on stellar and planetary properties.},

While in-depth observations of the nearest habitable worlds may yield enticing results, there are fundamental questions about planetary habitability and evolution which can only be answered through population-level studies of dozens to hundreds of terrestrial planets. To determine the requirements for next-generation observatories to address these questions, we have developed Bioverse. Bioverse combines existing knowledge of exoplanet statistics with a survey simulation and hypothesis testing framework to determine whether proposed space-based direct imaging and transit spectroscopy surveys will be capable of detecting various hypothetical statistical relationships between the properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Following a description of the code, we apply Bioverse to determine whether an ambitious direct imaging or transit survey would be able to determine the extent of the circumstellar habitable zone and study the evolution of Earth-like planets. Given recent evidence that Earth-sized habitable zone planets are likely much rarer than previously believed (Pascucci et al. 2019), we find that space missions with large search volumes will be necessary to study the population of terrestrial and habitable worlds. Moving forward, Bioverse provides a methodology for performing trade studies of future observatory concepts to maximize their ability to address population-level questions, including and beyond the specific examples explored here.},

When compared with other well-characterized exoplanetary systems, the particular combination of planetary radius and mass places our discovery in the radius gap, which is a transition region between rocky planets and planets with significant atmospheric envelopes. A few examples of planets occupying the radius gap are known to date. While the exact location of the radius gap for M dwarfs is still a matter of debate, our results constrain it to be located at around 1.7 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} or larger at the insolation levels received by TOI-1235 b (\textasciitilde 60 \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}). This makes it an extremely interesting object for further studies of planet formation and atmospheric evolution.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Ultracool dwarfs (UCD; Teff~\&lt;~{$\sim$}3000~K) cool to settle on the main sequence after~{$\sim$}1~Gyr. For brown dwarfs, this cooling never stops. Their habitable zones (HZ) thus sweeps inward at least during the first Gyr of their lives. Assuming they possess water, planets found in the HZ of UCDs have experienced a runaway greenhouse phase too hot for liquid water prior to enter the HZ. It has been proposed that such planets are desiccated by this hot early phase and enter the HZ as dry worlds. Here, we model the water loss during this pre-HZ hot phase taking into account recent upper limits on the XUV emission of UCDs and using 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. We address the whole range of UCDs but also focus on the planets recently found around the 0.08\,M{$\odot$} dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Despite assumptions maximizing the FUV photolysis of water and the XUV-driven escape of hydrogen, we find that planets can retain significant amount of water in the HZ of UCDs, with a sweet spot in the 0.04\textendash 0.06\,M{$\odot$} range. We also studied the TRAPPIST-1 system using observed constraints on the XUV flux. We find that TRAPPIST-1b and c may have lost as much as 15 Earth oceans and planet d \textendash{} which might be inside the HZ \textendash{} may have lost less than 1 Earth ocean. Depending on their initial water contents, they could have enough water to remain habitable. TRAPPIST-1 planets are key targets for atmospheric characterization and could provide strong constraints on the water erosion around UCDs.},

Our study aims to identify burnout profiles and highlight the corresponding job demands and resources, resulting in recommendations to reduce burnout risk in the academic context.MethodsThis cross-sectional study collected data from young researchers (n\,=\,1,123) at five Flemish universities through an online survey measuring burnout risk, work engagement, sleeping behavior, and the most prominent job demands (e.g., publication pressure) and resources (e.g., social support). We conducted Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify burnout profiles in young researchers and subsequently compared these groups on job demands and resources patterns.ResultsFive burnout profiles were identified: (1) High Burnout Risk (9.3\%), (2) Cynical (30.1\%), (3) Overextended (2.3\%), (4) Low Burnout Risk (34.8\%), and (5) No Burnout Risk (23.6\%). Each burnout profile was associated with a different pattern of job demands and resources. For instance, high levels of meaningfulness (OR\,=\,-1.96) decreased the odds to being classified in the Cynical profile.ConclusionOur findings show that the Cynical profile corresponds to a relatively high number of young researchers, which may imply that they are particularly vulnerable to the cynicism dimension of burnout. Additionally, work-life interference and perceived publication pressure seemed the most significant predictors of burnout risk, while meaningfulness, social support from supervisor and learning opportunities played an important protective role.},

The equilibrium state beyond the runaway greenhouse instellation limit depends on the radiative properties of the atmosphere and its temperature structure. Here, we use 1D radiative-convective models of steam atmospheres to explore the transition from the tropospheric radiation limit to the post-runaway climate state. To facilitate eventual simulations with 3D global circulation models, a computationally efficient band-gray model is developed, which is capable of reproducing the key features of the more comprehensive calculations. We analyze two factors that determine the equilibrated surface temperature of post-runaway planets. The infrared cooling of the planet is strongly enhanced by the penetration of the dry adiabat into the optically thin upper regions of the atmosphere. In addition, thermal emission of both shortwave and near-IR fluxes from the hot lower atmospheric layers, which can radiate through window regions of the spectrum, is quantified. Astronomical surveys of rocky exoplanets in the runaway greenhouse state may discriminate these features using multiwavelength observations.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial planets are easier to detect around M dwarfs than other types of stars, making them promising for next-generation atmospheric characterization studies. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has greatly increased the number of known M-dwarf planets that we can use to perform population studies, allowing us to explore how the rocky planet occurrence rate varies with host radius, following in the footsteps of past work with Kepler data. In this paper, we use simulations to assess TESS's yield of small (0.5 R {$\oplus$} {$<$} R p {$<$} 2 R {$\oplus$}) planet candidates around nearby (d {$<$} 30 pc) M dwarfs. We highlight the underappreciated fact that, while TESS was indeed expected to find a large number of planets around M dwarfs overall, it was not expected to have a high planetary yield for the latest M dwarfs. Furthermore, we find that TESS has detected fewer planets around stars with R {$\star$} {$<$} 0.3 R {$\odot$} than even was expected (11 observed versus 24 {$\pm$} 5 expected). We find evidence that the photometric noise of stars in the TESS bandpass increases with decreasing radius for M dwarfs. However, this trend cannot explain the observed distribution of planets. Our main conclusions are (1) the planet occurrence rate likely does not increase, and may decrease for the latest M dwarfs; and (2) there are at least 17, and potentially three times that number, transiting planets around nearby late-M dwarfs that still will not be detected by the end of TESS's fourth year.},

By combining these three data types, one can measure precise masses and sometimes orbital parameters even when the observations cover a small fraction of an orbit. The computational performance of orvara is achieved with an eccentric anomaly solver 5\textendash 10 times faster than commonly used approaches and low-level memory management to avoid Python overheads and by analytically marginalizing out parallax, barycenter proper motion, and instrument-specific radial velocity zero-points. Through its integration with the Hipparcos and Gaia intermediate astrometry package htof, orvara can properly account for the epoch astrometry measurements of Hipparcos and the measurement times and scan angles of individual Gaia epochs. We configure orvara with modifiable .ini configuration files tailored to any specific stellar or planetary system. We demonstrate orvara with a case study application to a recently discovered white dwarf/main-sequence system, HD 159062. By adding absolute astrometry to literature radial velocity and relative astrometry data, our comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis improves the precision of HD 159062B's mass by more than an order of magnitude to M {$\Sun$}.

This `bi-modality' was previously only seen in space-based data. We demonstrate that stars in sub-samples above and below the period gap appear to arise from a stellar population not significantly contaminated by excess multiple systems. We also observe a small population of long-period variable M-dwarfs, which highlight a departure from the predictions made by rotational evolution models fitted to solar-type main-sequence objects.

This core forms by accreting solids, either planetesimals or pebbles. A key constraint in this model is that the accretion of gas must proceed before the dissipation of the gas disc. Classical planetesimal accretion scenarios predict that the time needed to form a giant planet's core is much longer than the time needed to dissipate the disc. This difficulty led to the development of another accretion scenario, in which cores grow by accretion of pebbles, which are much smaller and thus more easily accreted, leading to more rapid formation.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The aim of this paper is to compare our updated pebble-based planet formation model with observations, in particular the well-studied metallicity effect.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We adopt the disc model and the pebble model and use a population synthesis approach to compare the formed planets with observations.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that keeping the same parameters as in leads to no planet growth due to a computation mistake in the pebble flux (2018b). Indeed a large fraction of the heavy elements should be put into pebbles (\emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{peb{$<$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{tot{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.9) in order to form massive planets using this approach. The resulting mass functions show a huge amount of giants and a lack of Neptune-mass planets, which are abundant according to observations. To overcome this issue we include the computation of the internal structure for the planetary atmosphere in our model. This leads to the formation of Neptune-mass planets but no observable giants. Furthermore, reducing the opacity of the planetary envelope more closely matches observations.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We conclude that modelling the internal structure for the planetary atmosphere is necessary to reproduce observations.}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} In the core accretion scenario of giant planet formation, a massive core forms first and then accretes a gaseous envelope. In the discussion of how this core forms, some divergences appear. The first scenarios of planet formation predict the accretion of kilometre-sized bodies called planetesimals, while more recent works suggest growth by the accretion of pebbles, which are centimetre-sized objects.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} These two accretion models are often discussed separately and our aim here is to compare the outcomes of the two models with identical initial conditions.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The comparison is done using two distinct codes, one that computes the planetesimal accretion and the other the pebble accretion. All the other components of the simulated planet growth are computed identically in the two models: the disc, the accretion of gas, and the migration. Using a population synthesis approach, we compare planet simulations and study the impact of the two solid accretion models, focusing on the formation of single planets.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that the outcomes of the populations are strongly influenced by the accretion model. The planetesimal model predicts the formation of more giant planets, while the pebble accretion model forms more super-Earth-mass planets. This is due to the pebble isolation mass (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{iso{$<$}sub/{$>$}) concept, which prevents planets formed by pebble accretion to accrete gas efficiently before reaching \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{iso{$<$}sub/{$>$}. This translates into a population of planets that are not heavy enough to accrete a consequent envelope, but that are in a mass range where type I migration is very efficient. We also find higher gas mass fractions for a given core mass for the pebble model compared to the planetesimal model, caused by luminosity differences. This also implies planets with lower densities, which could be confirmed observationally.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We conclude that the two models produce different outputs. Focusing on giant planets, the sensitivity of their formation differs: for the pebble accretion model, the time at which the embryos are formed and the period over which solids are accreted strongly impact the results, while the population of giant planets formed by planetesimal accretion depends on the planetesimal size and on the splitting in the amount of solids available to form planetesimals.}}}}}}}}}},

We consistently re-fit all published radial velocity datasets for a sample of 65 stars and find 9 systems with statistically significant trends indicating the presence of an outer companion. We combine these radial velocity data with AO images in order to constrain the allowed masses and semi-major axes of these companions. We quantify our sensitivity to the presence of long period companions by fitting the sample with a power law distribution and find an estimated occurrence rate of 39+/-7\% for companions between 0.5-20 M\_Jup and 1-20 AU. Half of our systems were discovered by the transit method and the other half were discovered by the RV method. While differences in RV baselines and number of data points between the two samples lead to different sensitivities to distant companions, we find that the occurrence rates of gas giant companions in each sample is consistent at the 0.5sigma level. We compare the frequency of Jupiter analogs in these systems to the equivalent rate from field star surveys and find that Jupiter analogs are more common around stars hosting super-Earths. We conclude that the presence of outer gas giant planets does not suppress the formation of inner super-Earths, and that these two populations of planets instead appear to be correlated with each other. We also find that the stellar metallicities of systems with gas giant companions are significantly higher than those without companions, in good agreement with the well-established metallicity correlation from RV surveys of field stars.},

The formation of giant planets around low-mass stars is predicted to be rare by the core-accretion planet formation theory. We search 91,306 low-mass stars in the TESS 30 minute cadence photometry detecting fifteen giant planet candidates, including seven new planet candidates which were not known planets or identified as TOIs prior to our search. Our candidates present an exciting opportunity to improve our knowledge of the giant planet population around the lowest mass stars. We perform planet injection-recovery simulations and find that our pipeline has a high detection efficiency across the majority of our targeted parameter space. We measure the occurrence rates of giant planets with host stars in different stellar mass ranges spanning our full sample. We find occurrence rates of \$0.137 \textbackslash pm 0.097\$\% (0.088 - 0.26 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$), \$0.108 \textbackslash pm 0.083\$\% (0.26 - 0.42 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$), and \$0.29 \textbackslash pm 0.15\$\% (0.42 - 0.71 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$). For our full sample (0.088 - 0.71 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) we find a giant planet occurrence rate of \$0.194 \textbackslash pm 0.072\$\%. We have measured for the first time the occurrence rate for giant planets orbiting stars with \$M\_\{*\} \textbackslash leq 0.4 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and we demonstrate this occurrence rate to be non-zero. This result contradicts currently accepted planet formation models and we discuss some possibilities for how these planets could have formed.},

These tests were tuned to obtain a reasonable but arbitrary balance between catalog completeness and reliability. We produce new catalogs with differing balances of completeness and reliability by varying these tests, and study the impact of these alternative catalogs on occurrence rates. We find that if there is no correction for reliability, different catalogs give statistically inconsistent occurrence rates, while if we correct for both completeness and reliability, we get statistically consistent occurrence rates. This is a strong indication that correction for completeness and reliability is critical for the accurate computation of occurrence rates. Additionally, we find that this result is the same whether using Bayesian Poisson-likelihood Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We also examine the use of a Robovetter disposition score cut as an alternative to reliability correction, and find that while a score cut does increase the reliability of the catalog, it is not as accurate as performing a full reliability correction. We get the same result when performing a reliability correction with and without a score cut. Therefore removing low-score planets removes data without providing any advantage, and should be avoided when possible. We make our alternative catalogs publicly available, and propose that these should be used as a test of occurrence rate methods, with the requirement that a method should provide statistically consistent occurrence rates for all these catalogs.},

We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define {$\eta\oplus$} as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that {$\eta\oplus$} for the conservative HZ is between (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between and planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is {$\sim$}6 pc away and there are {$\sim$}4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

This study examines planet occurrence rates for the Kepler GK dwarf target sample for planet radii, 2.5 , and orbital periods, 300 days, with an emphasis on a thorough exploration and identification of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties. Integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of F0 = 0.77 planets per star, with an allowed range of 1.9. The allowed range takes into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of F0 beyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis. We generally find higher planet occurrence rates and a steeper increase in planet occurrence rates toward small planets than previous studies of the Kepler GK dwarf sample. Through extrapolation, we find that the one year orbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate = 0.1, with an allowed range of 2, where is defined as the number of planets per star within 20\% of the and of Earth. For G dwarf hosts, the parameter space is a subset of the larger parameter space, thus places a lower limit on for G dwarf hosts. From our analysis, we identify the leading sources of systematics impacting Kepler occurrence rate determinations as reliability of the planet candidate sample, planet radii, pipeline completeness, and stellar parameters.},

As current surveys routinely detect planets down to terrestrial size in these systems, models have shifted toward a more holistic approach that reflects their diverse architectures.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here, we investigate planet formation around low-mass stars and identify differences in the statistical distribution of modeled planets. We compare the synthetic planet populations to observed exoplanets and we discuss the identified trends.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used the Generation III Bern global model of planet formation and evolution to calculate synthetic populations, while varying the central star from Solar-like stars to ultra-late M dwarfs. This model includes planetary migration, \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}-body interactions between embryos, accretion of planetesimals and gas, and the long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous atmospheres.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most frequent around early M dwarfs (0.3 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}\textendash 0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) and that they are more rare for Solar-type stars and late M dwarfs. The planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass. The reason behind this is attributed to the emergence of giant planets for \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\star<$}sub/{$>$} {$\geq$} 0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, which leads to the ejection of smaller planets. Given a linear scaling of the disk mass with stellar mass, the formation of Earth-like planets is limited by the available amount of solids for ultra-late M dwarfs. For \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\star<$}sub/{$>$} {$\geq$} 0.3 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, however, there is sufficient mass in the majority of systems, leading to a similar amount of Exo-Earths going from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths and larger planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further identify a regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems such as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs, such as GJ 3512b, only form when type I migration is substantially reduced.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We are able to quantify the stellar mass dependence of multi-planet systems using global simulations of planet formation and evolution. The results fare well in comparison to current observational data and predict trends that can be tested with future observations.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Millimeter astronomy provides valuable information on the birthplaces of planetary systems. In order to compare theoretical models with observations, the dust component has to be carefully calculated. Here, we aim to study the effects of dust entrainment in photoevaporative winds and the ejection and drag of dust due to effects caused by radiation from the central star. We improved and extended the existing implementation of a two-population dust and pebble description in the global Bern/Heidelberg planet formation and evolution model. Modern prescriptions for photoevaporative winds were used and we account for settling and advection of dust when calculating entrainment rates. In order to prepare for future population studies with varying conditions, we explore a wide range of disk-, photoevaporation-, and dust-parameters. We find that if dust can grow to pebble sizes, that is, if they are resistant to fragmentation or turbulence is weak, drift dominates and the entrained mass is small but larger than under the assumption of no vertical advection of grains with the gas flow. For the case of fragile dust shattering at velocities of 1 m/s - as indicated in laboratory experiments -, an order of magnitude more dust is entrained which becomes the main dust removal process. Radiation pressure effects disperse massive, dusty disks on timescales of a few 100 Myr. These results highlight the importance of dust entrainment in winds as a solid mass removal process. Furthermore, this model extension lies the basis for future statistical studies of planet formation in their birth environment.},

We propose that many of these planets may form through the Type-I migration of planets locked into a chain of mutual mean motion resonances. We ran N-body simulations of planetary embryos embedded in a protoplanetary disc. The embryos experienced gravitational scatterings, collisions, disc torques, and dampening of orbital eccentricity and inclination. We then modelled Kepler observations of these planets using a forward model of both the transit probability and the detection efficiency of the Kepler pipeline. We found that planets become locked into long chains of mean motion resonances that migrate in unison. When the chain reaches the edge of the disc, the inner planets are pushed past the edge due to the disc torques acting on the planets farther out in the chain. Our simulated systems successfully reproduce the observed period distribution of short-period Kepler planets between 1 and 2 R{$\oplus$}. However, we obtain fewer closely packed short-period planets than in the Kepler sample. Our results provide valuable insight into the planet formation process, and suggests that resonance locks, migration, and dynamical instabilities play important roles in the formation and evolution of close-in small exoplanets.},

  abstract = {The observed correlation between outer giant planets and inner super-Earths is emerging as an important constraint on planet formation theories. In this study we focus on Kepler-167, which is currently the only system known to contain both inner transiting super-Earths and a confirmed outer transiting gas giant companion beyond 1 au. Using long term radial velocity monitoring, we measure the mass of the gas giant Kepler-167e (\$P=1071\$ days) to be \$1.01\^\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.15\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm J\}\$, thus confirming it as a Jupiter analog. We re-fit the \$Kepler\$ photometry to obtain updated radii for all four planets. Using a planetary structure model, we estimate that Kepler-167e contains \$66\textbackslash pm19\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ of solids and is significantly enriched in metals relative to its solar-metallicity host star. We use these new constraints to explore the broader question of how systems like Kepler-167 form in the pebble accretion framework for giant planet core formation. We utilize simple disk evolution models to demonstrate that more massive and metal-rich disks, which are the most favorable sites for giant planet formation, can also deliver enough solids to the inner disk to form systems of super-Earths. We use these same models to constrain the nature of Kepler-167's protoplanetary disk, and find that it likely contained \$\textbackslash gtrsim 300\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ of dust and was \$\textbackslash gtrsim 40\$ au in size. These values overlap with the upper end of the observed dust mass and size distributions of Class 0 and I disks, and are also consistent with the observed occurrence rate of Jupiter analogs around sun-like stars.}

  abstract = {The observed correlation between outer giant planets and inner super-Earths is emerging as an important constraint on planet formation theories. In this study, we focus on Kepler-167, which is currently the only system known to contain both inner transiting super-Earths and a confirmed outer transiting gas giant companion beyond 1 au. Using long-term radial velocity monitoring, we measure the mass of the gas giant Kepler-167e (P = 1071 days) to be ?\{1.01\}\_\{-0.15\}\^\{+0.16\}\$ M J, thus confirming it as a Jupiter analog. We refit the Kepler photometry to obtain updated radii for all four planets. Using a planetary structure model, we estimate that Kepler-167e contains 66 {$\pm$} 19 M {$\oplus$} of solids and is significantly enriched in metals relative to its solar-metallicity host star. We use these new constraints to explore the broader question of how systems like Kepler-167 form in the pebble accretion framework for giant planet core formation. We utilize simple disk evolution models to demonstrate that more massive and metal-rich disks, which are the most favorable sites for giant planet formation, can also deliver enough solids to the inner disk to form systems of super-Earths. We use these same models to constrain the nature of Kepler-167's protoplanetary disk and find that it likely contained {$\greaterequivlnt$}300 M {$\oplus$} of dust and was {$\greaterequivlnt$}40 au in size. These values overlap with the upper end of the observed dust mass and size distributions of Class 0 and I disks and are also consistent with the observed occurrence rate of Jupiter analogs around Sun-like stars.},

  abstract = {The NASA K2 mission, salvaged from the hardware failures of the Kepler telescope, has continued Kepler's planet-hunting success. It has revealed nearly 500 transiting planets around the ecliptic plane, many of which are the subject of further study, and over 1000 additional candidates. Here we present the results of an ongoing project to follow-up and statistically validate new K2 planets, in particular to identify promising new targets for further characterization. By analyzing the reconnaissance spectra, high-resolution imaging, centroid variations, and statistical likelihood of the signals of 91 candidates, we validate 60 new planets in 46 systems. These include: a number of planets amenable to transmission spectroscopy (K2-384 f, K2-387 b, K2-390 b, K2-403 b, and K2-398 c), emission spectroscopy (K2-371 b, K2-370 b, and K2-399 b), and both (K2-405 b and K2-406 b); several systems with planets in or close to mean motion resonances (K2-381, K2-398) including a compact, TRAPPIST-1-like system of five small planets orbiting a mid-M dwarf (K2-384); an ultra-short period sub-Saturn in the hot Saturn desert (K2-399 b); and a super-Earth orbiting a moderately bright (V=11.93), metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-0.579+/-0.080) host star (K2-408 b). In total we validate planets around 4 F stars, 26 G stars, 13 K stars, and 3 M dwarfs.

  abstract = {Motivated by the order of magnitude difference in the frequency of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs inferred by microlensing and radial velocity (RV) surveys, we present a method for comparing the statistical constraints on exoplanet demographics inferred from these methods. We first derive the mapping from the observable parameters of a microlensing-detected planet to those of an analogous planet orbiting an RV-monitored star. Using this mapping, we predict the distribution of RV observables for the planet population inferred from microlensing surveys, taking care to adopt reasonable priors for, and properly marginalize over, the unknown physical parameters of microlensing-detected systems. Finally, we use simple estimates of the detection limits for a fiducial RV survey to predict the number and properties of analogs of the microlensing planet population such an RV survey should detect. We find that RV and microlensing surveys have some overlap, specifically for super-Jupiter mass planets (mp {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 MJup) with periods between {$\sim$}3\textendash 10 yr. However, the steeply falling planetary mass function inferred from microlensing implies that, in this region of overlap, RV surveys should infer a much smaller frequency than the overall giant planet frequency (mp {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.1 MJup) inferred by microlensing. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to statistically compare and synthesize data sets from multiple exoplanet detection techniques in order to infer exoplanet demographics over wider regions of parameter space than are accessible to individual methods. In a companion paper, we apply our methodology to several representative microlensing and RV surveys to derive the frequency of planets around M dwarfs with orbits of {$\lessequivlnt$} 30 yr.},

  abstract = {In contrast to radial velocity (RV) surveys, results from microlensing surveys indicate that giant planets with masses greater than the critical mass for core accretion ({$\sim$}0.1 MJup) are relatively common around low-mass stars. Using the methodology developed in the first paper, we predict the sensitivity of M-dwarf RV surveys to analogs of the population of planets inferred by microlensing. We find that RV surveys should detect a handful of super-Jovian ({$>$}MJup) planets at the longest periods being probed. These planets are indeed found by RV surveys, implying that the demographic constraints inferred from these two methods are consistent. Finally, we combine the results from both methods to estimate planet frequencies spanning wide regions of parameter space.

  abstract = {In recent years a paradigm shift has occurred in exoplanet science, wherein low-mass stars are increasingly viewed as a foundational pillar of the search for potentially habitable worlds in the solar neighborhood. However, the formation processes of this rapidly accumulating sample of planet systems are still poorly understood. Moreover, it is unclear whether tenuous primordial atmospheres around these Earth-analogs could have survived the intense epoch of heightened stellar activity that is typical for low-mass stars. We present new simulations of in-situ planet formation across the M-dwarf mass spectrum, and derive leftover debris populations of small bodies that might source delayed volatile delivery. We then follow the evolution of this debris with high-resolution models of real systems of habitable zone planets around low-mass stars such as TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Centauri and TOI-700. While debris in the radial vicinity of the habitable zone planets is removed rapidly, thus making delayed volatile delivery highly unlikely, we find that material ubiquitously scattered into an exo-asteroid belt region during the planet formation process represents a potentially lucrative reservoir of icy small bodies. Thus, the presence of external \textasciitilde Neptune-Saturn mass planets capable of dynamically perturbing these asteroids would be a sign that habitable zone worlds around low-mass stars might have avoided complete desiccation. However, we also find that such giant planets significantly limit the efficiency of asteroidal implantation during the planet formation process. In the coming decade, long-baseline radial velocity studies and Roman Space Telescope microlensing observations will undoubtedly further constrain this process.},

While it is still debated whether such a purposeful advertisement would be prudent and wise, we propose that mean-motion resonances between neighboring planets -- with orbital periods that form integer ratios -- could in principle be used to encode simple sequences that one would not expect to form in nature. In this Letter we build four multi-resonant planetary systems and test their long-term orbital stability. The four systems each contain 6 or 7 planets and consist of: (i) consecutive integers from 1 to 6; (ii) prime numbers from 2 to 11; (iii) the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 13; and (iv) the Lazy Caterer sequence from 1 to 16. We built each system using N-body simulations with artificial migration forces. We evaluated the stability of each system over the full 10 Gyr integration of the Sun's main sequence phase. We then tested the stability of these systems for an additional 10 Gyr, during and after post-main sequence evolution of the central stars (assumed to be Sun-like) to their final, white dwarf phase. The only system that was destabilized was the consecutive integer sequence (system i). The other three sequences therefore represent potential SETI beacons.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing power and numerical methodologies over the past several decades sparked a prolific output of dynamical investigations of the late stages of terrestrial planet formation. Among other peculiar inner solar system qualities, the ability of simulations to reproduce the small mass of Mars within the planets' geochemically inferred accretion timescale of {$<$}10 Myr after the appearance of calcium aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) is arguably considered the gold standard for judging evolutionary hypotheses. At present, a number of independent models are capable of consistently generating Mars-like planets and simultaneously satisfying various important observational and geochemical constraints. However, all models must still account for the effects of the epoch of giant planet migration and orbital instability; an event which dynamical and cosmochemical constraints indicate occurred within the first 100 Myr after nebular gas dispersal. If the instability occurred in the first few Myr of this window, the disturbance might have affected the bulk of Mars' growth. In this manuscript, we turn our attention to a scenario where the instability took place after t=50 Myr. Specifically, we simulate the instability's effects on three nearly-assembled terrestrial systems that were generated via previous embryo accretion models and contain three large proto-planets with orbits interior to a collection of \textasciitilde Mars-mass embryos and debris. While the instability consistently triggers a Moon-forming impact and efficiently removes excessive material from the Mars-region in our models, we find that our final systems are too dynamically excited and devoid of Mars and Mercury analogs. Thus, we conclude that, while possible, our scenario is far more improbable than one where the instability either occurred earlier, or at a time where Earth and Venus' orbits were far less dynamically excited.},

  abstract = {Studies of close-in planets orbiting M dwarfs have suggested that the M-dwarf radius valley may be well explained by distinct formation timescales between enveloped terrestrials and rocky planets that form at late times in a gas-depleted environment. This scenario is at odds with the picture that close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is subsequently stripped away by some thermally driven mass-loss process. These two physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped transition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the compositions of planets within the M-dwarf radius valley may be able to establish the dominant physics. Here, we present the discovery of one such keystone planet: the ultra-short-period planet TOI-1634 b (P = 0.989 days, , R {$\oplus$}) orbiting a nearby M2 dwarf (K s = 8.7, R s = 0.450 R {$\odot$}, M s = 0.502 M {$\odot$}) and whose size and orbital period sit within the M-dwarf radius valley. We confirm the TESS-discovered planet candidate using extensive ground-based follow-up campaigns, including a set of 32 precise radial velocity measurements from HARPS-N. We measure a planetary mass of M {$\oplus$}, which makes TOI-1634 b inconsistent with an Earth-like composition at and thus requires either an extended gaseous envelope, a large volatile-rich layer, or a rocky composition that is not dominated by iron and silicates to explain its mass and radius. The discovery that the bulk composition of TOI-1634 b is inconsistent with that of Earth supports the gas-depleted formation mechanism to explain the emergence of the radius valley around M dwarfs with M {$\odot$}.},

In this review on habitability, we define it as the ability of an environment to support the activity of at least one known organism. We adopt a binary definition of ``habitability'' and a ``habitable environment.'' An environment either can or cannot sustain a given organism. However, environments such as entire planets might be capable of supporting more or less species diversity or biomass compared with that of Earth. A clarity in understanding habitability can be obtained by defining instantaneous habitability as the conditions at any given time in a given environment required to sustain the activity of at least one known organism, and continuous planetary habitability as the capacity of a planetary body to sustain habitable conditions on some areas of its surface or within its interior over geological timescales. We also distinguish between surface liquid water worlds (such as Earth) that can sustain liquid water on their surfaces and interior liquid water worlds, such as icy moons and terrestrial-type rocky planets with liquid water only in their interiors. This distinction is important since, while the former can potentially sustain habitable conditions for oxygenic photosynthesis that leads to the rise of atmospheric oxygen and potentially complex multicellularity and intelligence over geological timescales, the latter are unlikely to. Habitable environments do not need to contain life. Although the decoupling of habitability and the presence of life may be rare on Earth, it may be important for understanding the habitability of other planetary bodies.

  abstract = {With the advent of direct imaging spectroscopy, the number of spectra from brown dwarfs and extrasolar gas giants is growing rapidly. Many brown dwarfs and extrasolar gas giants exhibit spectroscopic and photometric variability, which is likely the result of weather patterns. However, for the foreseeable future, point-source observations will be the only viable method to extract brown dwarf and exoplanet spectra. Models have been able to reproduce the observed variability, but ground truth observations are required to verify their results. To that end, we provide visual and near-infrared spectra of Jupiter and Saturn obtained from the \textbackslash emph\{Cassini\} VIMS instrument. We disk-integrate the VIMS spectral cubes to simulate the spectra of Jupiter and Saturn as if they were directly imaged exoplanets or brown dwarfs. We present six empirical disk-integrated spectra for both Jupiter and Saturn with phase coverage of \$1.7\^\textbackslash circ\$ to \$133.5\^\textbackslash circ\$ and \$39.6\^\textbackslash circ\$ to \$110.2\^\textbackslash circ\$, respectively. To understand the constituents of these disk-integrated spectra, we also provide end member (single feature) spectra for permutations of illumination and cloud density, as well as for Saturn's rings. In tandem, these disk-integrated and end member spectra provide the ground truth needed to analyze point source spectra from extrasolar gas giants and brown dwarfs. Lastly, we discuss the impact that icy rings, such as Saturn's, have on disk-integrated spectra and consider the feasibility of inferring the presence of rings from direct imaging spectra.},

  abstract = {Oxygenic photosynthesis is the most important biochemical process in Earth biosphere and likely very common on other habitable terrestrial planets, given the general availability of its input chemical ingredients and of light as source of energy. It is therefore important to evaluate the effective possibility of oxygenic photosynthesis on planets around stars as a function of their spectral type and the planet\textendash star separation. We aim at estimating the photon flux, the exergy, and the exergetic efficiency of the radiation in the wavelength range useful for the oxygenic photosynthesis as a function of the host star effective temperature and planet\textendash star separation. We compute analytically these quantities and compare our results with the estimates for the small sample of known Earth-like planets. We find that exergy is an increasing function of the star effective temperature, within the range 2600\textendash 7200\,K. It depends both on the star\textendash planet separation and the star effective temperature. Biospheres on exoplanets around cool stars might be generally light-limited. So far, we have not observed terrestrial planets comparable to Earth in terms of useful photon flux, exergy, and exergetic efficiency.},

  abstract = {Precise mass measurements of exoplanets discovered by the direct imaging or transit technique are required to determine planet bulk properties and potential habitability. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged that, for the foreseeable future, the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) measurement technique is the only method potentially capable of detecting and measuring the masses and orbits of habitable-zone Earths orbiting nearby F, G, and K spectral-type stars from the ground. In particular, EPRV measurements with a precision of better than approximately 10 cm/s (with a few cm/s stability over many years) are required. Unfortunately, for nearly a decade, PRV instruments and surveys have been unable to routinely reach RV accuracies of less than roughly 1 m/s. Making EPRV science and technology development a critical component of both NASA and NSF program plans is crucial for reaching the goal of detecting potentially habitable Earthlike planets and supporting potential future exoplanet direct imaging missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) or the Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR). In recognition of these facts, the 2018 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Exoplanet Science Strategy (ESS) report recommended the development of EPRV measurements as a critical step toward the detection and characterization of habitable, Earth-analog planets. In response to the NAS-ESS recommendation, NASA and NSF commissioned the EPRV Working Group to recommend a ground-based program architecture and implementation plan to achieve the goal intended by the NAS. This report documents the activities, findings, and recommendations of the EPRV Working Group.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Planet formation is a frequent process, but little observational constraints exist about the mechanisms involved, especially for giant planets at large separation. The NaCo-ISPY large program is a 120 night \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>{'}$}-band direct imaging survey aimed at investigating the giant planet population on wide orbits (\emph{a{$<$}i/{$>$} {$>$} 10 au) around stars hosting disks.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here we present the statistical analysis of a subsample of 45 young stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks (PPDs). This is the largest imaging survey uniquely focused on PPDs to date. Our goal is to search for young forming companions embedded in the disk material and to constrain their occurrence rate in relation to the formation mechanism.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used principal component analysis based point spread function subtraction techniques to reveal young companions forming in the disks. We calculated detection limits for our datasets and adopted a black-body model to derive temperature upper limits of potential forming planets. We then used Monte Carlo simulations to constrain the population of forming gas giant companions and compare our results to different types of formation scenarios.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our data revealed a new binary system (HD 38120) and a recently identified triple system with a brown dwarf companion orbiting a binary system (HD 101412), in addition to 12 known companions. Furthermore, we detected signals from 17 disks, two of which (HD 72106 and T CrA) were imaged for the first time. We reached median detection limits of \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>{'}$} = 15.4 mag at 2{${''}$}.0, which were used to investigate the temperature of potentially embedded forming companions. We can constrain the occurrence of forming planets with semi-major axis \emph{a{$<$}i/{$>$} in [20\textendash 500] au and \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} in [600\textendash 3000] K to be , , and for \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 2, 3, 5 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$}, which is in line with the statistical results obtained for more evolved systems from other direct imaging surveys. These values are obtained under the assumption that extinction from circumstellar and circumplanetary material does not affect the companion signal, but we show the potential impact these factors might have on the detectability of forming objects.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The NaCo-ISPY data confirm that massive bright planets accreting at high rates are rare. More powerful instruments with better sensitivity in the near- to mid-infrared are likely required to unveil the wealth of forming planets sculpting the observed disk substructures.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

HIP 99770 b is the first exoplanet ever discovered jointly through direct imaging and astrometry and the first discovery leveraging on \$\textbackslash mu\$-arcsecond precision Gaia astrometry. HIP 99770 b is in a low-eccentricity orbit \$\textbackslash sim\$16.9 au from the primary, receiving about as much light as Jupiter does from the Sun. The planet induces an astrometric acceleration on the host star; its directly-measured companion-to-primary mass ratio is similar to that of many radial-velocity detected planets and some of the first imaged exoplanets, including HR 8799 cde. The planet's spectrum reveals an atmosphere resembling a slightly less cloudy and likely older analogue of these first imaging discoveries, enabling a new, critical probe of how gas giant planets evolve with time. HIP 99770 b's discovery is a direct proof-of-concept for a fundamentally new strategy for finding imageable planets: selecting targets based on dynamical evidence from indirect methods like astrometry instead of conducting blind searches. This combined approach prefigures the campaigns that could one day directly detect and characterize an extrasolar Earth-like planet.},

In order to quantify the science potential of such a mission, in particular in the context of technical trade-offs, an instrument simulator is required. In addition, signal extraction algorithms are needed to verify that exoplanet properties (e.g., angular separation, spectral flux) contained in simulated exoplanet datasets can be accurately retrieved. We present LIFEsim, a software tool developed for simulating observations of exoplanetary systems with an MIR space-based nulling interferometer. It includes astrophysical noise sources (i.e., stellar leakage and thermal emission from local zodiacal and exo-zodiacal dust) and offers the flexibility to include instrumental noise terms in the future. LIFEsim provides an accessible way for predicting the expected SNR of future observations as a function of various key instrument and target parameters. The SNRs of the extracted spectra are photon-noise dominated, as expected from our current simulations. From single epoch observations in our mock survey of small (\$R {$<$} 1.5 R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{Earth\}\$) planets orbiting within the habitable zones of their stars, we find that typical uncertainties in the estimated effective temperature of the exoplanets are \$\textbackslash lesssim\$10\%, for the exoplanet radius \$\textbackslash lesssim\$20\%, and for the separation from the host star \$\textbackslash lesssim\$2\%. SNR values obtained in the signal extraction process deviate less than 10\% from purely photon-counting statistics based SNRs. (abridged)},

  abstract = {Exoplanet orbital eccentricities offer valuable clues about the history of planetary systems. Eccentric, Jupiter-sized planets are particularly interesting: they may link the ``cold'' Jupiters beyond the ice line to close-in hot Jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. To date, eccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radial-velocity measurements. Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters spanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes radial-velocity follow-up of most. Here, we demonstrate a Bayesian method of measuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit light curve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. We show that eccentric Jupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transit durations\textemdash part of the ``photoeccentric'' light curve signature of a planet's eccentricity\textemdash even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and loosely constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and automatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use three published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity of e = 0.71+0.16- 0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e = 0.67 {$\pm$} 0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. We present two additional tests using Kepler data. In each case, the technique proves to be a viable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidence intervals. Finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effective means of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto-hot Jupiters predicted by Socrates et al.},

This loss of sea ice represents one of the most severe positive feedbacks in the climate system, as sunlight that would otherwise be reflected by sea ice is absorbed by open ocean. It is unlikely that CO2 levels and mean temperatures can be decreased in time to prevent this loss, so restoring sea ice artificially is an imperative. Here we investigate a means for enhancing Arctic sea ice production by using wind power during the Arctic winter to pump water to the surface, where it will freeze more rapidly. We show that where appropriate devices are employed, it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels, by about 1 m over the course of the winter. We examine the effects this has in the Arctic climate, concluding that deployment over 10\% of the Arctic, especially where ice survival is marginal, could more than reverse current trends of ice loss in the Arctic, using existing industrial capacity. We propose that winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps be considered and assessed as part of a multipronged strategy for restoring sea ice and arresting the strongest feedbacks in the climate system.},

K2-3 is an early M dwarf hosting three small exoplanets (1.5-2.0 Earth radii) at distances of 0.07-0.20 AU. We measure the high-energy spectrum of K2-3 with HST/COS and XMM-Newton, and use empirically-driven estimates of Ly-alpha and extreme ultraviolet flux. We use EXOFASTv2 to jointly fit radial velocity, transit, and SED data. This constrains the K2-3 planet radii to 4\% uncertainty and the masses of K2-3b and c to 13\% and 30\%, respectively; K2-3d is not detected in RV measurements. K2-3b and c are consistent with rocky cores surrounded by solar composition envelopes (mass fractions of 0.36\% and 0.07\%), H2O envelopes (55\% and 16\%), or a mixture of both. However, based on the high-energy output and estimated age of K2-3, it is unlikely that K2-3b and c retain solar composition atmospheres. We pass the planet parameters and high-energy stellar spectrum to atmospheric models. Dialing the high-energy spectrum up and down by a factor of 10 produces significant changes in trace molecule abundances, but not at a level detectable with transmission spectroscopy. Though the K2-3 planets span the small planet radius valley, the observed system architecture cannot be readily explained by photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. We instead propose 1) the K2-3 planets are all volatile-rich, with K2-3d having a lower density than typical of super-Earths, and/or 2) the K2-3 planet architecture results from more stochastic processes such as planet formation, planet migration, and impact erosion.},

  abstract = {Earth-sized exoplanets that transit nearby, late spectral type red dwarfs will be prime targets for atmospheric characterization in the coming decade. Such systems, however, are difficult to find via wide-field transit surveys like Kepler or TESS. Consequently, the presence of such transiting planets is unexplored and the occurrence rates of short-period Earth-sized planets around late M dwarfs remain poorly constrained. Here, we present the deepest photometric monitoring campaign of 22 nearby late M dwarf stars, using data from over 500 nights on seven 1-2 meter class telescopes. Our survey includes all known single quiescent northern late M dwarfs within 15 pc. We use transit-injection-and-recovery tests to quantify the completeness of our survey, successfully identify most (\${$>$}80\textbackslash\%\$) transiting short-period (0.5-1 d) super-Earths (\$R {$>$} 1.9 R\_\textbackslash oplus\$), and are sensitive (\$\textbackslash sim50\textbackslash\%\$) to transiting Earth-sized planets (\$1.0-1.2 R\_\textbackslash oplus\$). Our high sensitivity to transits with a near-zero false positive rate demonstrates an efficient survey strategy. Our survey does not yield a transiting planet detection, yet it provides the most sensitive upper limits on transiting planets orbiting our target stars. Finally, we explore multiple hypotheses about the occurrence rates of short-period planets (from Earth-sized planets to giant planets) around late M dwarfs. We show, for example, that giant planets at short periods (\${$<$}1\$ day) are uncommon around our target stars. Our dataset provides some insight into occurrence rates of short-period planets around TRAPPIST-1-like stars, and our results can help test planetary formation and system evolution models, as well as guide future observations of nearby late M dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Interior characterization traditionally relies on individual planetary properties, ignoring correlations between different planets of the same system. For multiplanetary systems, planetary data are generally correlated. This is because the differential masses and radii are better constrained than absolute planetary masses and radii. We explore such correlations and data specific to the multiplanetary system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our understanding of planet interiors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rocky interior of planets in a multiplanetary system can be preferentially probed by studying the densest planet representing a rocky interior analog. Our methodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. Our interior estimates account for the anticipated variability in the compositions and layer thicknesses of core, mantle, water oceans, and ice layers, as well as a gas envelope. Our results show that (1) interior estimates significantly depend on available abundance proxies and (2) the importance of interdependent planetary data for interior characterization is comparable to changes in data precision by 30\%. For the interiors of TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that possible water mass fractions generally range from 0\% to 25\%. The lack of a clear trend of water budgets with orbital period or planet mass challenges possible formation scenarios. While our estimates change relatively little with data precision, they critically depend on data accuracy. If planetary masses varied within {$\pm$}24\%, interiors would be consistent with uniform ({$\sim$}7\%) or an increasing water mass fractions with orbital period ({$\sim$}2\%-12\%).},

Such differences in the observed bulk density of planets may occur as a function of radial location and time of planet formation. In this work, we show that the predicted differences are on the cusp of being detectable with current instrumentation. In fact, for HD 219134, the 10~per\,cent lower bulk density of planet b compared to planet c could be explained by enhancements in Ca-, Al-rich minerals. However, we also show that the 11~per\,cent uncertainties on the individual bulk densities are not sufficiently accurate to exclude the absence of a density difference as well as differences in volatile layers. Besides HD 219134 b, we demonstrate that 55 Cnc e and WASP-47 e are similar candidates of a new Super-Earth class that have no core and are rich in Ca and Al minerals that are among the first solids that condense from a cooling proto-planetary disc. Planets of this class have densities 10\textendash 20~per\,cent lower than Earth-like compositions and may have very different interior dynamics, outgassing histories, and magnetic fields compared to the majority of Super-Earths.},

Here we present an advanced interior model for water-rich rocky exoplanets. The new model allows us to test the effects of rock melting and the redistribution of water between magma ocean and atmosphere on calculated planet radii. Models with and without rock melting and water partitioning lead to deviations in planet radius of up to 16\% for a fixed bulk composition and planet mass. This is within the current accuracy limits for individual systems and statistically testable on a population level. Unrecognized mantle melting and volatile redistribution in retrievals may thus underestimate the inferred planetary bulk water content by up to 1 order of magnitude.},

We build on past thermal-orbital models and incorporate the evolution of the lunar figure including a fossil figure component. Obliquity tidal heating in the lunar magma ocean would have produced rapid inclination damping, making it difficult for an early inclination to survive to the present-day. An early inclination is preserved only if the solid-body of the early Moon were less dissipative than at present. If instabilities at the Laplace plane transition were the source of the inclination, then the Moon had to recede slowly, which is consistent with previous findings of a weakly dissipative early Earth. If collisionless encounters with planetesimals up to 140 Myr after Moon formation excited the inclination, then the Moon had to migrate quickly to pass through the Cassini state transition at 33 Earth radii and reach a period of limited inclination damping. The fossil figure was likely established before 16 Earth radii to match the present-day degree-2 gravity field observations.},

This latter factor means that the approximately 6 TB of data collected annually must be processed on site automatically, with only final data products being sent once a day to Europe. In this context, we present the current state of operations of ASTEP+, a 40 cm optical telescope located at Concordia Station in Antarctica. Following a successful summer campaign, ASTEP+ has begun the 2022 observing season with a brand-new two-colour photometer with increased sensitivity. A new Python data analysis pipeline installed on a dedicated server in Concordia will significantly improve the precision of the extracted photometry, enabling us to get higher signal-to-noise transit detections. The new pipeline additionally incorporates automatic transit modelling to reduce the amount of manual post-processing required. It also handles the automatic daily transfer of the photometric lightcurves and control data to Europe. Additionally, we present the Python and web-based systems used for selection and scheduling of transit observations; these systems have wide applicability for the scheduling of other astronomical observations with strong time constraints. We also review the type of science that ASTEP+ will be conducting and analyse how unique ASTEP+ is to exoplanet transit research.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of planet formation has been rapidly evolving in recent years. The classical planet formation theory, developed when the only known planetary system was our own Solar System, has been revised to account for the observed diversity of the exoplanetary systems. At the same time, the increasing observational capabilities of the young stars and their surrounding disks bring new constraints on the planet formation process. In this chapter, we summarize the new information derived from the exoplanets population and the circumstellar disks observations. We present the new developments in planet formation theory, from dust evolution to the growth of planetary cores by accretion of planetesimals, pebbles, and gas. We review the state-of-the-art models for the formation of diverse planetary systems, including the population synthesis approach which is necessary to compare theoretical model outcomes to the exoplanet population. We emphasize that the planet formation process may not be spatially uniform in the disk and there are preferential locations for the formation of planetesimals and planets. Outside of these locations, a significant fraction of solids is not growing past the pebble-sizes. The reservoir of pebbles plays an important role in the growth of planetary cores in the pebble accretion process. The timescale of the emergence of massive planetary cores is an important aspect of the present models and it is likely that the cores within one disk form at different times. In addition, there is growing evidence that the first planetary cores start forming early, during the circumstellar disk buildup process.},

We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R{$\oplus$}) and super-Earths (1.5-2 R{$\oplus$}) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R{$\oplus$} and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 {$\pm$} 0.4 pc and pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.2 pc and pc.},

  abstract = {Context: Recent observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) have shown that the large dust aggregates observed at millimeter wavelengths settle to the midplane into a remarkably thin layer. Aims: We intend to find out if the geometric thinness of these layers is evidence against the vertical shear instability (VSI) operating in these disks. Methods: We performed hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk with a locally isothermal equation of state, and let the VSI fully develop. We sprinkled dust particles and followed their motion as they got stirred up by the VSI. We determined for which grain size the layer becomes geometrically thin enough to be consistent with ALMA observations. We then verified if, with these grain sizes, it is still possible to generate a moderately optically thick layer at millimeter wavelengths, as observations appear to indicate. Results: We found that even very large dust aggregates with Stokes numbers close to unity get stirred up to relatively large heights above the midplane by the VSI, which is in conflict with the observed geometric thinness. For grains so large that the Stokes number exceeds unity, the layer can be made to remain thin, but we show that it is hard to make dust layers optically thick at ALMA wavelengths (e.g., tau(1.3mm){$>$}=1) with such large dust aggregates. Conclusions: We conclude that protoplanetary disks with geometrically thin midplane dust layers cannot be VSI unstable, at least not down to the disk midplane. Explanations for the inhibition of the VSI include a reduced dust-to-gas ratio of the small dust grains that are responsible for the radiative cooling of the disk. A reduction of small grains by a factor of between 10 and 100 is sufficient to quench the VSI. Such a reduction is plausible in dust growth models, and still consistent with observations at optical and infrared wavelengths.},

Here we present a study of Ariel's capability to observe currently known exoplanets and predicted Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) discoveries. We use the Ariel radiometric model (ArielRad) to simulate the instrument performance and find that {$\sim$}2000 of these planets have atmospheric signals which could be characterized by Ariel. This list of potential planets contains a diverse range of planetary and stellar parameters. From these we select an example mission reference sample (MRS), comprised of 1000 diverse planets to be completed within the primary mission life, which is consistent with previous studies. We also explore the mission capability to perform an in-depth survey into the atmospheres of smaller planets, which may be enriched or secondary. Earth-sized planets and super-Earths with atmospheres heavier than H/He will be more challenging to observe spectroscopically. However, by studying the time required to observe {$\sim$}110 Earth-sized/super-Earths, we find that Ariel could have substantial capability for providing in-depth observations of smaller planets. Trade-offs between the number and type of planets observed will form a key part of the selection process and this list of planets will continually evolve with new exoplanet discoveries replacing predicted detections. The Ariel target list will be constantly updated and the MRS re-selected to ensure maximum diversity in the population of planets studied during the primary mission life.},

By providing homogeneous data sets with a high signal-to-noise ratio and wide wavelength coverage, Ariel will unveil the atmospheric demographics of these faraway worlds, helping to constrain planet formation and evolution processes on a galactic scale. Ariel seeks to undertake a statistical survey of a diverse population of planets; therefore, the sample of planets from which this selection can be made is of the utmost importance. While many suitable targets have already been found, hundreds more will be discovered before the mission is operational. Previous studies have used predictions of exoplanet detections to forecast the available planet population by the launch date of Ariel, with the most recent noting that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) alone should provide over 1000 potential targets. In this work, we consider the planet candidates found to date by TESS to show that, with the addition of already confirmed planets, Ariel will already have a more than sufficient sample to choose its target list from once these candidates are validated. We showcase the breadth of this population, as well as exploring, for the first time, the ability of Ariel to characterize multiple planets within a single system. Comparative planetology of worlds orbiting the same star, as well as across the wider population, will undoubtedly revolutionize our understanding of planet formation and evolution.},

We identified the system as a black hole candidate via its astrometric orbital solution from the Gaia mission. Radial velocities validated and refined the Gaia solution, and spectroscopy ruled out significant light contributions from another star. Joint modeling of radial velocities and astrometry constrains the companion mass to M2 = 9.62 {$\pm$} 0.18\,M{$\odot$}. The spectroscopic orbit alone sets a minimum companion mass of M2 \&gt; 5\,M{$\odot$}; if the companion were a 5\,M{$\odot$} star, it would be 500~times more luminous than the entire system. These constraints are insensitive to the mass of the luminous star, which appears as a slowly-rotating G dwarf (\$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=5850\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm K\$, log\,g = 4.5, M = 0.93\,M{$\odot$}), with near-solar metallicity (\$\textbackslash rm [Fe/H] = -0.2\$) and an unremarkable abundance pattern. We find no plausible astrophysical scenario that can explain the orbit and does not involve a black hole. The orbital period, Porb = 185.6~days, is longer than that of any known stellar-mass black hole binary. The system's modest eccentricity (e = 0.45), high metallicity, and thin-disk Galactic orbit suggest that it was born in the Milky Way disk with at most a weak natal kick. How the system formed is uncertain. Common envelope evolution can only produce the system's wide orbit under extreme and likely unphysical assumptions. Formation models involving triples or dynamical assembly in an open cluster may be more promising. This is the nearest known black hole by a factor of 3, and its discovery suggests the existence of a sizable population of dormant black holes in binaries. Future Gaia releases will likely facilitate the discovery of dozens more.},

  abstract = {Context.               The explosion of observational data on exoplanets gives many constraints on theoretical models of planet formation and evolution. Observational data probe very large areas of the parameter space and many different planet properties.                                         Aims.               Comparing theoretical models with observations allows one to take a key step forward towards understanding planetary systems. It however requires a model able to (i) predict all the necessary observable quantities (not only masses and orbits, but also radii, luminosities, magnitudes, or evaporation rates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary masses (from Mars mass to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits).                                         Methods.               We have developed a combined global end-to-end planetary formation and evolution model, the Generation III Bern model, based on the core accretion paradigm. This model solves as directly as possible the underlying differential equations for the structure and evolution of the gas disc, the dynamical state of the planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets yielding their planetesimal and gas accretion rates, disc-driven orbital migration, and the gravitational interaction of concurrently forming planets via a full               N               -body calculation. Importantly, the model also follows the long-term evolution of the planets on gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling and contraction, atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides.                                         Results.               To test the model, we compared it with classical scenarios of Solar System formation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain a giant impact phase of protoplanet-protoplanet collisions provided enough embryos (\textasciitilde 100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For the giant planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core shortly before the dispersal of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration that would bring them to the inner edge of the disc. Regarding the emergence of entire planetary systems, many aspects can be understood with the comparison of the timescales of growth and migration, the capture into resonances, and the consequences of large-scale dynamical instabilities caused by the gravitational interactions of protoplanets, including the situation when a second core starts runaway gas accretion.                                         Conclusions.               The Generation III Bern model provides one of the most comprehensive global end-to-end models of planetary system formation and evolution developed so far, linking a multitude of crucial physical processes self-consistently. The model can form planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that systems with only terrestrial planets are often well-ordered (in period, mass, and radius), while giant-planet bearing systems show no such similarity. In a series of papers, the model will be used to perform extensive planetary population syntheses, putting the current theoretical understanding of planet formation and evolution to the observational test.},

  abstract = {Context.               Planetary formation and evolution is a combination of multiple interlinked processes. Constraining the mechanisms observationally requires statistical comparison to a large diversity of planetary systems.                                         Aims.               We want to understand global observable consequences of different physical processes (accretion, migration, and interactions) and initial properties (like disc masses and metallicities) on the demographics of the planetary population. We also want to study the convergence of our scheme with respect to one initial condition, the initial number of planetary embryo in each disc.                                         Methods.               We selected distributions of initial conditions that are representative of known protoplanetary discs. Then, we used the Generation III Bern model to perform planetary population synthesis. We synthesise five populations with each a different initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last is our nominal population consisting of 1000 stars (systems) that was used for an extensive statistical analysis of planetary systems around 1               M               {$\odot$}               stars.                                         Results.               The properties of giant planets do not change much as long as there are at least ten embryos in each system. The study of giants can thus be done with simulations requiring less computational resources. For inner terrestrial planets, only the 100-embryos population is able to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each planetary system contains, on average, eight planets more massive than 1               M               {$\oplus$}               . The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital distances is 18\%, but only 1.6\% are at {$>$}10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such planets. The planetary mass function varies as               M               -2               between 5 and 50               M               {$\oplus$}               . Both at lower and higher masses, it follows approximately               M               -1               . The frequency of terrestrial and super-Earth planets peaks at a stellar [Fe/H] of -0.2 and 0.0, respectively, being limited at lower [Fe/H] by a lack of building blocks, and by (for them) detrimental growth of more massive dynamically active planets at higher [Fe/H]. The frequency of more massive planets (Neptunian, giants) increases monotonically with [Fe/H]. The fast migration of planets in the 5\textendash 50               M               {$\oplus$}               range is reduced by the presence of multiple lower-mass inner planets in the multi-embryos populations. To assess the impact of parameters and model assumptions, we also study two non-nominal populations: insitu formation without gas-driven migration, and a different initial planetesimal surface density.                                         Conclusions.               We present one of the most comprehensive simulations of (exo)planetary system formation and evolution to date. For observations, the syntheses provides a large data set to search for comparison synthetic planetary systems that show how these systems have come into existence. The systems, including their full formation and evolution tracks are available online. For theory, they provide the framework to observationally test the global statistical consequences of theoretical models for specific physical processes. This is an important ingredient towards the development of a standard model of planetary formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {Planetary population synthesis is a tool to understand the physics of planetary system formation. It builds on a model that includes a multitude of physical processes. The outcome can be statistically compared with exoplanet observations. Here, we review the population synthesis method and then use one population to explore how different planetary system architectures emerge and which conditions lead to their formation. The systems can be classified into four main architectures: Class I of near-in situ compositionally ordered terrestrial and ice planets, Class II of migrated sub-Neptunes, Class III of mixed low-mass and giant planets, broadly similar to the Solar System, and Class IV of dynamically active giants without inner low-mass planets. These four classes exhibit distinct typical formation pathways and are characterised by certain mass scales. Class I systems form from the local accretion of planetesimals followed by a giant impact phase, and the final planet masses correspond to the `Goldreich mass'. Class II systems form when planets reach the `equality mass' (equal accretion and migration timescales) before the dispersal of the gas disc, but not large enough to allow for rapid gas accretion. Giant planets form when the `equality mass' allows for rapid gas accretion while the planet are migrating, i.e. when the critical core mass is reached. The main discriminant of the four classes is the initial mass of solids in the disc, with contributions from the lifetime and mass of the gas disc. The breakdown into classes allows to better understand which physical processes are dominant. Comparison with observations reveals certain differences to the actual population, pointing at limitation of theoretical understanding. For example, the overrepresentation of synthetic super Earths and sub-Neptunes in Class I causes these planets to be found at lower metallicities than in observations.},

We present and statistically analyze the results from the LBTI/Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems survey for exozodiacal dust. By comparing our measurements to model predictions based on the solar zodiacal dust in the N band, we estimate a 1{$\sigma$} median sensitivity of 23 zodis times the solar system dust surface density in its habitable zone (HZ; 23 zodis) for early-type stars and 48 zodis for Sun-like stars, where 1 zodi is the surface density of HZ dust in the solar system. Of the 38 stars observed, 10 show significant excess. A clear correlation of our detections with the presence of cold dust in the systems was found, but none with the stellar spectral type or age. The majority of Sun-like stars have relatively low HZ dust levels (best-fit median: 3 zodis, 1{$\sigma$} upper limit: 9 zodis, 95\% confidence: 27 zodis based on our N band measurements), while {$\sim$}20\% are significantly more dusty. The solar system's HZ dust content is consistent with being typical. Our median HZ dust level would not be a major limitation to the direct imaging search for Earth-like exoplanets, but more precise constraints are still required, in particular to evaluate the impact of exozodiacal dust for the spectroscopic characterization of imaged exo-Earth candidates.},

We predict that these planets will have atmospheres that are typically reduced in their C/O compared to parent star values independent of the assessed formation locations, with C/O {$<$} 1 a nearly universal outcome within the framework of the model. We expect water vapor absorption features to be ubiquitous in the atmospheres of these planets, and by extension, other gas giants.},

The studies demonstrate that whether variety increases or decreases happiness depends on the perceived duration of the time within which the activities occur. For longer time periods (like a day), variety does increase happiness. However, for shorter time periods (like an hour), variety instead decreases happiness. This reversal stems from people's sense of stimulation and productivity during that time. Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness). These effects are robust across actual and perceived variety, actual and perceived time duration, and multiple types of activities (work and leisure, self-selected and imposed, social and solo). Together the findings confirm that ``variety is the spice of life''\textemdash but not of an hour.},

(2013). These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using a generic mass\textendash radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating {$\sim$}96\% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.\textdegree 0\textendash 2.\textdegree 2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

Here, we derive giant planets occurrence rates as a function of orbital period by taking into account the detection efficiency of the Kepler and radial velocity (RV) surveys. The giant planet occurrence rates for Kepler and RV show the same rising trend with increasing distance from the star. We identify a break in the RV giant planet distribution between {$\sim$}2 and 3 au\textemdash close to the location of the snow line in the solar system\textemdash after which the occurrence rate decreases with distance from the star. Extrapolating a broken power-law distribution to larger semimajor axes, we find good agreement with the {$\sim$}1\% planet occurrence rates from direct imaging surveys. Assuming a symmetric power law, we also estimate that the occurrence of giant planets between 0.1 and 100 au is for planets with masses 0.1\textendash 20 MJ and decreases to for planets more massive than Jupiter. This implies that only a fraction of the structures detected in disks around young stars can be attributed to giant planets. Various planet population synthesis models show good agreement with the observed distribution, and we show how a quantitative comparison between model and data can be used to constrain planet formation and migration mechanisms.},

Here, we present pterodactyls, a data reduction pipeline specifically built to address the challenges in discovering exoplanets around young stars and to work with TESS Primary Mission 30-minute cadence photometry, since most young stars were not preselected TESS two-minute cadence targets. pterodactyls builds on publicly available and tested tools in order to extract, detrend, search, and vet transiting young planet candidates. We search five clusters with known transiting planets: the Tucana\textendash Horologium Association, IC 2602, Upper Centaurus Lupus, Ursa Major, and Pisces\textendash Eridani. We show that pterodactyls recovers seven out of the eight confirmed planets and one out of the two planet candidates, most of which were initially detected in two-minute cadence data. For these clusters, we conduct injection-recovery tests to characterize our detection efficiency, and compute an intrinsic planet occurrence rate of 49\% {$\pm$} 20\% for sub-Neptunes and Neptunes (1.8\textendash 6 R {$\oplus$}) within 12.5 days, which is higher than Kepler's Gyr-old occurrence rates of 6.8\% {$\pm$} 0.3\%. This potentially implies that these planets have shrunk with time due to atmospheric mass loss. However, a proper assessment of the occurrence of transiting young planets will require a larger sample unbiased to planets already detected. As such, pterodactyls will be used in future work to search and vet for planet candidates in nearby clusters and moving groups.},

  abstract = {Regular, low-cost Decadal-class science missions to planetary destinations will be enabled by high-\{\textbackslash Delta\}V small spacecraft, such as the high-energy Photon, and small launch vehicles, such as Electron, to support expanding opportunities for scientists and to increase the rate of science return. The Rocket Lab mission to Venus is a small direct entry probe planned for baseline launch in May 2023 with accommodation for a single \textasciitilde 1 kg instrument. A backup launch window is available in January 2025. The probe mission will spend about 5 min in the Venus cloud layers at 48-60 km altitude above the surface and collect in situ measurements. We have chosen a low-mass, low-cost autofluorescing nephelometer to search for organic molecules in the cloud particles and constrain the particle composition.},

  abstract = {The size of a planet is an observable property directly connected to the physics of its formation and evolution. We used precise radius measurements from the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) to study the size distribution of 2025 \$\textbackslash backslashtextit\{Kepler\}\$ planets in fine detail. We detect a factor of \$\textbackslash backslashgeq\$2 deficit in the occurrence rate distribution at 1.5-2.0 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. This gap splits the population of close-in (\$P\$ \textbackslash textless 100 d) small planets into two size regimes: R\$\_P\$ \textbackslash textless 1.5 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ and R\$\_P\$ = 2.0-3.0 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$, with few planets in between. Planets in these two regimes have nearly the same intrinsic frequency based on occurrence measurements that account for planet detection efficiencies. The paucity of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ supports the emerging picture that close-in planets smaller than Neptune are composed of rocky cores measuring 1.5 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ or smaller with varying amounts of low-density gas that determine their total sizes.},

  abstract = {The distribution of planet sizes encodes details of planet formation and evolution. We present the most precise planet size distribution to date based on Gaia parallaxes, Kepler photometry, and spectroscopic temperatures from the California-Kepler Survey. Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11\% precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the errors are now 3\%. Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5\% precision. With a catalog of {$\sim$}1000 planets with precise properties, we probed in fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two classes of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes. Our previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially filled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a planet's orbital distance and its host-star mass, both of which are related to a planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower-mass stars, the bimodal planet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars producing smaller planet cores. Details of the size distribution including the extent of the ``sub-Neptune desert'' and the width and slope of the gap support the view that photoevaporation of low-density atmospheres is the dominant evolutionary determinant of the planet size distribution.},

  abstract = {We used high-precision radial velocity measurements of FGKM stars to determine the occurrence of giant planets as a function of orbital separation spanning 0.03\textendash 30 au. Giant planets are more prevalent at orbital distances of 1\textendash 10 au compared to orbits interior or exterior of this range. The increase in planet occurrence at {$\sim$}1 au by a factor of {$\sim$}4 is highly statistically significant. A fall-off in giant planet occurrence at larger orbital distances is favored over models with flat or increasing occurrence. We measure giant planets per 100 stars with semimajor axes of 2\textendash 8 au and giant planets per 100 stars in the range 8\textendash 32 au, a decrease in occurrence with increasing orbital separation that is significant at the {$\sim$}2{$\sigma$} level. We find that the occurrence rate of sub-Jovian planets (0.1\textendash 1 Jupiter masses) is also enhanced for 1\textendash 10 au orbits. This suggests that lower-mass planets may share the formation or migration mechanisms that drive the increased prevalence near the water\textendash ice line for their Jovian counterparts. Our measurements of cold gas giant occurrence are consistent with the latest results from direct imaging surveys and gravitational lensing surveys despite different stellar samples. We corroborate previous findings that giant planet occurrence increases with stellar mass and metallicity.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} We present the early installment of the third \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data release, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} A summary of the contents of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 results.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The raw data collected with the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. \emph{Results. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (\emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} - \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$}) colour are also available. The passbands for \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3. Finally, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3.\emph{Conclusions. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 represents a significant advance over \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30\textendash 40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor \textasciitilde 2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The Gaia DR3 Catalogue contains for the first time about eight hundred thousand solutions with either orbital elements or trend parameters for astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and combinations of them. This paper aims to illustrate the huge potential of this large non-single star catalogue. Using the orbital solutions together with models of the binaries, a catalogue of tens of thousands of stellar masses, or lower limits, partly together with consistent flux ratios, has been built. Properties concerning the completeness of the binary catalogues are discussed, statistical features of the orbital elements are explained and a comparison with other catalogues is performed. Illustrative applications are proposed for binaries across the H-R diagram. The binarity is studied in the RGB/AGB and a search for genuine SB1 among long-period variables is performed. The discovery of new EL CVn systems illustrates the potential of combining variability and binarity catalogues. Potential compact object companions are presented, mainly white dwarf companions or double degenerates, but one candidate neutron star is also presented. Towards the bottom of the main sequence, the orbits of previously-suspected binary ultracool dwarfs are determined and new candidate binaries are discovered. The long awaited contribution of Gaia to the analysis of the substellar regime shows the brown dwarf desert around solar-type stars using true, rather than minimum, masses, and provides new important constraints on the occurrence rates of substellar companions to M dwarfs. Several dozen new exoplanets are proposed, including two with validated orbital solutions and one super-Jupiter orbiting a white dwarf, all being candidates requiring confirmation. Beside binarity, higher order multiple systems are also found.},

  abstract = {Age is a stellar parameter that is both fundamental and difficult to determine. Among middle-aged M dwarfs, the most prolific hosts of close-in and detectable exoplanets, gyrochronology is the most promising method to assign ages, but requires calibration by rotation-temperature sequences (gyrochrones) in clusters of known ages. We curated a catalog of 249 late K- and M-type (Teff=3200-4200K) exoplanet host stars with established rotation periods, and applied empirical, temperature-dependent rotation-age relations based on relevant published gyrochrones, including one derived from observations of the 4~Gyr-old open cluster M67. We estimated ages for 227 of these stars, and upper limits for 8 others, excluding 14 which are too rapidly rotating or are otherwise outside the valid parameter range of our gyrochronology. We estimated uncertainties based on observed scatter in rotation periods in young clusters, error in the gyrochrones, and uncertainties in temperature and non-solar metallicity. For those stars with measured metallicities, we provide but do not incorporate a correction for the effects of deviation from solar-metallicity. The age distribution of our sample declines to near zero at 10~Gyr, the age of the Galactic disk, with the handful of outliers explainable by large uncertainties. Continued addition or extension of cluster rotation sequences to more thoroughly calibrate the gyrochronology in time and temperature space, more precise and robust measurement of rotation periods, and more accurate stellar parameter measurements will enable continued improvements in the age estimates of these important exoplanet host stars.},

  abstract = {We put forward a model for accretion disks around T Tauri stars. The model assumes that angular momentum transport is driven by magnetic fields and can occur only in those parts of the disk that are sufficiently ionized that the gas can couple to the magnetic field. These regions lie at R {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.1 AU, where collisional ionization is effective, and at R {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.1 AU in a layer of thickness {$\asymp$} 100 g cm-2 at the surface of the disk where cosmic-ray ionization is effective. The model predicts that the stellar accretion rate is about 10-8 Msun yr-1, independent of the rate of infall onto the disk. Matter that is not accreted onto the star accumulates in the inner few AU of the disk at a rate of about 10-3 Msun in 104 yr. Given this buildup it is unlikely that accretion is steady. The effective temperature profile is Te {$\sim$} r-1/2 outside of 0.1 AU, which differs from the canonical Te {$\sim$} r-3/4. We calculate the expected spectral energy distribution for the disk and show that this temperature profile produces an infrared excess. Finally, we discuss some of the leading uncertainties in the theory.},

We adopt stellar parameters from the TESS Input Catalog, and construct a sample of 60,819 M dwarfs with \$10.5 \textbackslash leq T\_\{\textbackslash rm mag\}\textbackslash leq 13.5\$, effective temperature \$2900 \textbackslash leq T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}\textbackslash leq 4000\textbackslash{} K\$ and stellar mass \$0.45\textbackslash leq M\_\{\textbackslash ast\}\textbackslash leq 0.65\textbackslash{} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We conduct a uninformed transit search using a detection pipeline based on the box least square search and characterize the searching completeness through an injection and recovery experiment. We combine a series of vetting steps including light centroid measurement, odd/even and secondary eclipse analysis, rotation and transit period synchronization tests as well as inspecting the ground-based photometric, spectroscopic and imaging observations. Finally, we find a total of nine planet candidates, all of which are known TESS objects of interest. We obtain an occurrence rate of \$0.27\textbackslash pm0.09\textbackslash\%\$ for hot Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs that satisfy our selection criteria. Compared with previous studies, the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs is smaller than all measurements for FGK stars, although they are consistent within 1--2\$\textbackslash sigma\$. Combining results from transit, radial velocity and microlensing surveys, we find that hot Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs possibly show a steeper decrease in occurrence rate per logarithmic semi-major axis bin (\$\{\{\textbackslash rm d\}N\}/\{\textbackslash rm d\}\textbackslash log\_\{10\} a\$) when compared with FGK stars.},

  abstract = {We propose to develop a wide-field and ultra-high-precision photometric survey mission, temporarily named "Earth 2.0 (ET)". This mission is designed to measure, for the first time, the occurrence rate and the orbital distributions of Earth-sized planets. ET consists of seven 30cm telescopes, to be launched to the Earth-Sun's L2 point. Six of these are transit telescopes with a field of view of 500 square degrees. Staring in the direction that encompasses the original Kepler field for four continuous years, this monitoring will return tens of thousands of transiting planets, including the elusive Earth twins orbiting solar-type stars. The seventh telescope is a 30cm microlensing telescope that will monitor an area of 4 square degrees toward the galactic bulge. This, combined with simultaneous ground-based KMTNet observations, will measure masses for hundreds of long-period and free-floating planets. Together, the transit and the microlensing telescopes will revolutionize our understandings of terrestrial planets across a large swath of orbital distances and free space. In addition, the survey data will also facilitate studies in the fields of asteroseismology, Galactic archeology, time-domain sciences, and black holes in binaries.},

TOI-1860 is the youngest (\$133 \textbackslash pm 26\$ Myr) solar twin with a known planet to date.

A systematic search and selection were carried out on a surface of {$\sim$}16 000 deg\^2 on almost the whole area of the FBS. Since 2007, all FBS low-resolution spectral plates have been digitized. The second version of the "Revised and Updated Catalogue of the First Byurakan Survey of Late-Type Stars", containing data for 1471 M and C (carbon) stars (130 C-type giants, 1105 M - giants, and 236 M dwarfs) was generated.

(2021), which is based on the EDR3 parallaxes are used to estimate the G-band absolute magnitudes for M dwarfs. 9 FBS M dwarfs (out of 176 new discovered) lie within 25 pc of the Sun.

This object can be classified as M1-M2 sub-type dwarf. The nearest object is FBS 0250+167, a M7 subtype dwarf with very high proper motion (5.13 arcsec/yr) and is located at 3.83 pc from the Sun. The TESS estimated masses lie in the range 095 ({$\pm$}0.02) M\_sun {$\leq$} M {$\leq$} 0.7 ({$\pm$} 0.1) M\_sun and T\_eff in the range 4000K {$<$} T\_eff {$<$} 2790K for FBS M dwarfs.

  abstract = {Stellar mass is a fundamental parameter that is key to our understanding of stellar formation and evolution, as well as the characterization of nearby exoplanet companions. Historically, stellar masses have been derived from long-term observations of visual or spectroscopic binary star systems. While advances in high-resolution imaging have enabled observations of systems with shorter orbital periods, stellar mass measurements remain challenging, and relatively few have been precisely measured. We present a new statistical approach to measuring masses for populations of stars. Using Gaia astrometry, we analyze the relative orbital motion of \${$>$}3,800\$ wide binary systems comprising low-mass stars to establish a Mass-Magnitude relation in the Gaia \$G\_\textbackslash mathrm\{RP\}\$ band spanning the absolute magnitude range \$14.5{$>$}M\_\{G\_\textbackslash mathrm\{RP\}\}{$>$}4.0\$, corresponding to a mass range of \$0.08\$\textasciitilde M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\textbackslash lesssim M\textbackslash lesssim1.0\$\textasciitilde M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. This relation is directly applicable to \${$>$}30\$ million stars in the Gaia catalog. Based on comparison to existing Mass-Magnitude relations calibrated for 2MASS \$K\_\{s\}\$ magnitudes, we estimate that the internal precision of our mass estimates is \$\textbackslash sim\$10\$\textbackslash\%\$. We use this relation to estimate masses for a volume-limited sample of \$\textbackslash sim\$18,200 stars within 50\textasciitilde pc of the Sun and the present-day field mass function for stars with \$M\textbackslash lesssim 1.0\$\textasciitilde M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, which we find peaks at 0.16\textasciitilde M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We investigate a volume-limited sample of wide binary systems with early K dwarf primaries, complete for binary mass ratios \$q{$>$}0.2\$, and measure the distribution of \$q\$ at separations \${$>$}100\$\textasciitilde au. We find that our distribution of \$q\$ is not uniformly distributed, rather decreasing towards \$q=1.0\$.},

Here, we evaluate the usefulness of carbon dioxide isotopologues as evidence of aerial life. Carbon isotopes are of particular interest as metabolic processes preferentially use the lighter \$\^\{12\}\$C over \$\^\{13\}\$C. In principle, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to spectrally resolve the \$\^\{12\}\$C and \$\^\{13\}\$C isotopologues of CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but not CO and CH\$\_\{4\}\$. We simulated observations of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues in the H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmospheres of our nearest (\${$<$} 40\$ pc), temperate (equilibrium temperature of 250-350 K) sub-Neptunes with M dwarf host stars. We find \$\^\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \$\^\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ distinguishable if the atmosphere is H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated with a few percentage points of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ for the most idealized target with an Earth-like composition of the two most abundant isotopologues, \$\^\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \$\^\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$. With a Neptune-like metallicity of 100\$\textbackslash times\$ solar and a C/O of 0.55, we are unable to distinguish between \$\^\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \$\^\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes. If atmospheric composition largely follows metallicity scaling, the concentration of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in a H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmosphere will be too low to distinguish CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues with JWST. In contrast, at higher metallicities, there will be more CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but the smaller atmospheric scale height makes the measurement impossible. Carbon dioxide isotopologues are unlikely to be useful biosignature gases for the JWST era. Instead, isotopologue measurements should be used to evaluate formation mechanisms of planets and exoplanetary systems.},

  abstract = {The ultimate climate emergency is a `runaway greenhouse': a hot and water-vapour-rich atmosphere limits the emission of thermal radiation to space, causing runaway warming. Warming ceases only after the surface reaches approximately 1400\,K and emits radiation in the near-infrared, where water is not a good greenhouse gas. This would evaporate the entire ocean and exterminate all planetary life. Venus experienced a runaway greenhouse in the past, and we expect that the Earth will in around 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases. But could we bring on such a catastrophe prematurely, by our current climate-altering activities? Here, we review what is known about the runaway greenhouse to answer this question, describing the various limits on outgoing radiation and how climate will evolve between these. The good news is that almost all lines of evidence lead us to believe that is unlikely to be possible, even in principle, to trigger full a runaway greenhouse by addition of non-condensible greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, our understanding of the dynamics, thermodynamics, radiative transfer and cloud physics of hot and steamy atmospheres is weak. We cannot therefore completely rule out the possibility that human actions might cause a transition, if not to full runaway, then at least to a much warmer climate state than the present one. High climate sensitivity might provide a warning. If we, or more likely our remote descendants, are threatened with a runaway greenhouse, then geoengineering to reflect sunlight might be life's only hope. Injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere would be too short-lived, and even sunshades in space might require excessive maintenance. In the distant future, modifying Earth's orbit might provide a sustainable solution. The runaway greenhouse also remains relevant in planetary sciences and astrobiology: as extrasolar planets smaller and nearer to their stars are detected, some will be in a runaway greenhouse state.},

  abstract = {The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are expected to be in long-term radiation balance: an increase in the absorption of solar radiation warms the surface and troposphere, which leads to a matching increase in the emission of thermal radiation. Warming a wet planet such as Earth would make the atmosphere moist and optically thick such that only thermal radiation emitted from the upper troposphere can escape to space. Hence, for a hot moist atmosphere, there is an upper limit on the thermal emission that is unrelated to surface temperature. If the solar radiation absorbed exceeds this limit, the planet will heat uncontrollably and the entire ocean will evaporate\textemdash the so-called runaway greenhouse. Here we model the solar and thermal radiative transfer in incipient and complete runaway greenhouse atmospheres at line-by-line spectral resolution using a modern spectral database. We find a thermal radiation limit of 282\,W\,m-2 (lower than previously reported) and that 294\,W\,m-2 of solar radiation is absorbed (higher than previously reported). Therefore, a steam atmosphere induced by such a runaway greenhouse may be a stable state for a planet receiving a similar amount of solar radiation as Earth today. Avoiding a runaway greenhouse on Earth requires that the atmosphere is subsaturated with water, and that the albedo effect of clouds exceeds their greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing, but anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient.},

  abstract = {There are four different stable climate states for pure water atmospheres, as might exist on so-called ``waterworlds.'' I map these as a function of solar constant for planets ranging in size from Mars-sized to 10 Earth-mass. The states are as follows: globally ice covered (Ts{$\lessapprox$}245\,K), cold and damp (270{$\lessapprox$}Ts{$\lessapprox$}290\,K), hot and moist (350{$\lessapprox$}Ts{$\lessapprox$}550\,K), and very hot and dry (Tsx2A86;900\,K). No stable climate exists for 290{$\lessapprox$}Ts {$\lessapprox$}350\,K or 550{$\lessapprox$}Ts{$\lessapprox$}900\,K. The union of hot moist and cold damp climates describes the liquid water habitable zone, the width and location of which depends on planet mass. At each solar constant, two or three different climate states are stable. This is a consequence of strong nonlinearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight. Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to high altitudes as they warm. The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth of unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet surface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the former dominates). The atmospheres of small planets expand more due to weaker gravity; the effective runaway greenhouse threshold is about 35\,W m-2 higher for Mars, 10\,W m-2 higher for Earth or Venus, but only a few W m-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet. There is an underlying (expansion-neglected) trend of increasing runaway greenhouse threshold with planetary size (40\,W m-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet than for Mars). Summing these opposing trends means that Venus-sized (or slightly smaller) planets are most susceptible to a runaway greenhouse. The habitable zone for pure water atmospheres is very narrow, with an insolation range of 0.07 times the solar constant. A wider habitable zone requires background gas and greenhouse gas: N2 and CO2 on Earth, which are biologically controlled. Thus, habitability depends on inhabitance.

  abstract = {Reflection spectroscopy holds great promise for characterizing the atmospheres and surfaces of potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets. The surface of the modern Earth exhibits a sharp albedo change near 750 nm caused by vegetation - the red edge - which would leave a strong spectral signature if present on an exoplanet. However, the retrieval of wavelength-dependent surface properties from reflection spectra has seen relatively little study. Here, we propose a new surface albedo parameterization capable of retrieving the wavelength location of a priori unknown 'edge-like' features. We demonstrate that a wavelength-dependent surface albedo model achieves higher accuracy in retrieving atmospheric composition. Wavelength-dependent surfaces are also generally preferred over a uniform albedo model when retrieving simulated reflection spectra for a modern Earth analog, even for moderate signal-to-noise ratios (S/N = 10) and Earth-like clouds. Further, the location of the modern Earth's red edge can be robustly and precisely constrained (within 70 nm for S/N = 10). Our results suggest that future space-based direct imaging missions have the potential to infer surface compositions for rocky exoplanets, including spectral edges similar to those caused by life on the modern Earth.},

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated that planets belonging to the same close-in, compact multiple-planet system tend to exhibit a striking degree of uniformity in their sizes. A similar trend has also been found to hold for the masses of such planets, but considerations of such intra-system mass uniformity have generally been limited to statistical samples wherein a majority of systems have constituent planetary mass measurements obtained via analysis of transit timing variations (TTVs). Since systems with strong TTV signals typically lie in or near mean motion resonance, it remains to be seen whether intra-system mass uniformity is still readily emergent for nonresonant systems with non-TTV mass provenance. We thus present in this work a mass uniformity analysis of 17 non-TTV systems with masses measured via radial velocity measurements. Using the Gini index, a common statistic for economic inequality, as our primary metric for uniformity, we find that our sample of 17 non-TTV systems displays intra-system mass uniformity at a level of {$\sim$}2.5{$\sigma$} confidence. We provide additional discussion of possible statistical and astrophysical underpinnings for this result. We also demonstrate the existence of a correlation (r = 0.25) between characteristic solid surface density ({$\Sigma$}0) of the minimum-mass extrasolar nebula and system mass Gini index, suggesting that more-massive disks may generally form systems with more-unequal planetary masses.},

However, variations in global carbon budget and unstable feedback cycles between planetary sub-systems may destabilize the climate of rocky exoplanets toward regimes unknown in the Solar System. Here, we perform clear-sky atmospheric radiative transfer and surface weathering simulations to probe the stability of climate equilibria for rocky, ocean-bearing exoplanets at instellations relevant for planetary systems in the outer regions of the circumstellar habitable zone. Our simulations suggest that planets orbiting G- and F-type stars (but not M-type stars) may display bistability between an Earth-like climate state with efficient carbon sequestration and an alternative stable climate equilibrium where CO\$\_2\$ condenses at the surface and forms a blanket of either clathrate hydrate or liquid CO\$\_2\$. At increasing instellation and with ineffective weathering, the latter state oscillates between cool, surface CO\$\_2\$-condensing and hot, non-condensing climates. CO\$\_2\$ bistable climates may emerge early in planetary history and remain stable for billions of years. The carbon dioxide-condensing climates follow an opposite trend in \$p\$CO\$\_2\$ versus instellation compared to the weathering-stabilized planet population, suggesting the possibility of observational discrimination between these distinct climate categories.},

Values of planetary albedo, infrared radiant emittance, and the resulting net radiation budget are now available for 39 months during the period 1962\textendash 66. These measurements show a mean global albedo of 30\%, and net radiation balance within measurement accuracy. The discussion treats global and zonally averaged values for the ``mean annual'' case, for ``mean seasons,'' and includes a comparison of measurements during the same seasons in different years. The role of these radiation budget measurements in the total global energy balance is noted.},

Being interested in possible application of the results to the formation of planetesimals in the vicinity of clumps and spiral arms in a circumstellar disk, we numerically integrate the equations of motion of such solids and study their migrations for different values of their sizes and masses and also for different physical properties of the gas, such as its density and temperature. We show that, considering the drag force of the gas, it is possible for solids, within a certain range of size and mass, to migrate rapidly (i.e., within \textasciitilde 1000 yr) toward the location of a local maximum density, where collisions and coagulation may result in an accelerated rate of planetesimal formation.},

  abstract = {Starlink is a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation operated by Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) which aims to provide global satellite internet access. Thus far, most photometric observations of Starlink satellites have primarily been from citizen scientists' visual observations without using quantitative detectors. This paper aims to characterize Starlink satellites and investigate the impact of mega constellations on ground-based astronomy, considering both the observed magnitude and two-line element (TLE) residuals. We collected 353 observations of 61 different Starlink satellites over a 16-month period and we found an average GAIA G magnitude of 5.5~{$\pm~$}0.13 with a standard deviation of 1.12. The average magnitude of V1.0 (pre-VisorSat) Starlinks was 5.1~{$\pm~$}0.13 with a standard deviation of 1.13. SpaceX briefly used a low-albedo coating on a Starlink satellite called DarkSat to test light pollution mitigation technologies. The brightness of DarkSat was found to be 7.3~{$\pm~$}0.13 with a standard deviation of 0.78, or 7.6 times fainter than V1.0 Starlinks. This concept was later abandoned due to thermal control issues and sun visors were used in future models called VisorSats. The brightness of VisorSats was found to be 6.0~{$\pm~$}0.13 with a standard deviation of 0.79, or 2.3 times fainter than V1.0 Starlinks. Over the span of the observations, we found that TLEs were accurate to within an average of 0.12 degrees in right ascension and \textendash 0.08 degrees in declination. The error is predominantly along-track, corresponding to a 0.3 second time error between the observed and TLE trajectories. Our observations show that a time difference of 0.3~{$\pm~$}0.28 seconds is viable for a proposed 10 second shutter closure time to avoid Starlinks in images.},

However, such a detection would likely require a dedicated study, occupying a large amount of telescope time. It is therefore prudent, while searching for signs of life that we may recognise, to pick the best target possible. In this work, we present a new region, the ``photosynthetic habitable zone'' - the distance from a star where both liquid water and oxygenic photosynthesis can occur. It is therefore the region where detectable biosignatures of oxygenic photosynthesis are most likely to occur. Our analysis indicates that in the most ideal conditions for life and no atmospheric and greenhouse effects, the photosynthetic habitable zone is almost as broad as the habitable zone. On the other hand, if conditions for life are anything less than excellent and atmospheric attenuation and greenhouse effects are even moderate, the photosynthetic habitable zone is concentrated at larger separations around more massive stars. Such cases are also not tidally locked to their host star, which could result in planetary rotation periods similar to the Earth's. We identify five planets, Kepler-452 b, Kepler-1638 b, Kepler-1544 b and Kepler-62 e and Kepler-62 f, that are consistently in the photosynthetic habitable zone for a variety of conditions, and we predict their day lengths to be between 9 and 11 hours. We conclude that the parameter space in which we should search for signs of life is much narrower than the standard habitable zone.},

  abstract = {We present the thermal evolution and emergent spectra of solidifying terrestrial planets along with the formation of steam atmospheres. The lifetime of a magma ocean and its spectra through a steam atmosphere depends on the orbital distance of the planet from the host star. For a Type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal emission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately 106 years. Therefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in this orbital region. In contrast, a Type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared atmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L bands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star contrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10-7\textendash 10-8. Our model predicts that, in the Type II orbital region, molten planets would be present over the main sequence of the G-type host star if the initial bulk content of water exceeds approximately 1 wt\%. In visible atmospheric windows, the contrasts of the thermal emission drop below 10-10 in less than 105 years, whereas those of the reflected light remain 10-10 for both types of planets. Since the contrast level is comparable to those of reflected light from Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, the visible reflected light from molten planets also provides a promising target for direct imaging with future ground- and space-based telescopes.},

It is estimated that the host masses are in the range of 0.45 {$\lessequivlnt$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>\lessequivlnt$} 0.59, which corresponds to early M to late K dwarfs, and thus the host stars are less massive than the Sun.

The planets in all systems lie beyond the snow lines of the hosts, and thus the discovered planetary systems, together with many other microlensing planetary systems, support the idea that massive gas-giant planets are commonplace around low-mass stars.

  abstract = {(Abridged) Context: In the previous paper in this series, we identified that a pentagonal arrangement of five telescopes, using a kernel-nulling beam combiner, shows notable advantages for some important performance metrics for a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer over several other considered configurations for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets around solar-type stars. Aims: We aim to produce a practical implementation of a kernel-nulling beam combiner for such a configuration, as well as a discussion of systematic and stochastic errors associated with the instrument. Methods: We develop the mathematical framework around a beam-combiner based on a nulling combiner first suggested by Guyon et al. (2013), and then use it along with the simulator developed in the previous paper to identify the effects of systematic uncertainties. Results: We find that errors in the beam combiner optics, systematic phase errors and the RMS fringe tracking errors result in instrument limited performance at \$\textbackslash sim\$4-7 \$\textbackslash mu\$m, and zodiacal limited at \$rsim\$10 \$\textbackslash mu\$m. Assuming a beam splitter reflectance error of \$|\textbackslash Delta R| = 5\textbackslash\%\$ and phase shift error of \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash phi = 3\$ degrees, we find that the fringe tracking RMS should be kept to less than 3 nm in order to be photon limited, and the systematic piston error be less than 0.5 nm to be appropriately sensitive to planets with a contrast of 1\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-7\}\$ over a 4-19 \$\textbackslash mu\$m bandpass. We also identify that the beam combiner design, with the inclusion of a well positioned shutter, provides an ability to produce robust kernel observables even if one or two collecting telescopes were to fail. The resulting four telescope combiner, when put into an X-array formation, results in a transmission map with an relative SNR equivalent to 80\% of the fully functioning X-array combiner.},

  abstract = {An expanding civilization could spread rapidly through the Galaxy, so the absence of extraterrestrial settlement in the solar system implies that such expansionist civilizations do not exist. This argument, often referred to as the Fermi paradox, typically assumes that expansion would proceed uniformly through the Galaxy, but not all stellar types may be equally useful for a long-lived civilization. We suggest that low-mass stars, and K-dwarf stars in particular, would be ideal migration locations for civilizations that originate in a G-dwarf system. We use a modified form of the Drake equation to show that expansion across all low-mass stars could be accomplished in 2 Gyr, which includes waiting time between expansion waves to allow for a close approach to a suitable destination star. This would require interstellar travel capabilities of no more than {$\sim$}0.3 lt-yr to settle all M-dwarfs and {$\sim$}2 lt-yr to settle all K-dwarfs. Even more rapid expansion could occur within 2 Myr, with travel requirements of {$\sim$}10 lt-yr to settle all M-dwarfs and {$\sim$}50 lt-yr to settle all K-dwarfs. The search for technosignatures in exoplanetary systems can help to place constraints on the presence of such a ``low-mass Galactic Club'' in the Galaxy today.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Results indicate that prior to two billion years ago the Earth had a partially reduced atmosphere, which included N2, CO2, reduced carbon compounds, some NH3, but no free H2. Surface temperatures were higher than now, due to a large greenhouse effect. When free O2 appeared the temperature fell sharply. Had Earth been only slightly further from the Sun, runaway glaciation would have occured at that time. Simulations also indicate that a runaway greenhouse would have occured early in Earth's history had Earth been only a few percent closer to the Sun. It therefore appears that, taking into account the possibilities of either runaway glaciation or a runaway greenhouse effect, the continously habitable zone about a solar-type star is rather narrow, extending only from roughly 0.95 to 1.01 AU.},

  abstract = {A foundational idea in the theory of in situ planet formation is the "minimum mass extrasolar nebula" (MMEN), a surface density profile (\$\textbackslash Sigma\$) of disk solids that is necessary to form the planets in their present locations. While most previous studies have fit a single power-law to all exoplanets in an observed ensemble, it is unclear whether most exoplanetary systems form from a universal disk template. We use an advanced statistical model for the underlying architectures of multi-planet systems to reconstruct the MMEN. The simulated physical and Kepler-observed catalogs allows us to directly assess the role of detection biases, and in particular the effect of non-transiting or otherwise undetected planets, on altering the inferred MMEN. We find that fitting a power-law of the form \$\textbackslash Sigma = \textbackslash Sigma\_0\^* (a/a\_0)\^\textbackslash beta\$ to each multi-planet system results in a broad distribution of disk profiles; \$\textbackslash Sigma\_0\^* = 336\_\{-291\}\^\{+727\}\$ g/cm\$\^2\$ and \$\textbackslash beta = -1.98\_\{-1.52\}\^\{+1.55\}\$ encompasses the 16th-84th percentiles of the marginal distributions in an underlying population, where \$\textbackslash Sigma\_0\^*\$ is the normalization at \$a\_0 = 0.3\$ AU. Around half of inner planet-forming disks have minimum solid masses of \$rsim 40 M\_\textbackslash oplus\$ within 1 AU. While transit observations do not tend to bias the median \$\textbackslash beta\$, they can lead to both significantly over- and under-estimated \$\textbackslash Sigma\_0\^*\$ and thus broaden the inferred distribution of disk masses. Nevertheless, detection biases cannot account for the full variance in the observed disk profiles; there is no universal MMEN if all planets formed in situ. The great diversity of solid disk profiles suggests that a substantial fraction of planetary systems experienced a history of migration.},

  abstract = {The Juno mission has revolutionized and challenged our understanding of Jupiter. As Juno transitioned to its extended mission, we review the major findings of Jupiter's internal structure relevant to understanding Jupiter's formation and evolution. Results from Juno's investigation of Jupiter's interior structure imply that the planet has compositional gradients and is accordingly non-adiabatic, with a complex internal structure. These new results imply that current models of Jupiter's formation and evolution require a revision. In this paper, we discuss potential formation and evolution paths that can lead to an internal structure model consistent with Juno data, and the constraints they provide. We note that standard core accretion formation models, including the heavy-element enrichment during planetary growth is consistent with an interior that is inhomogeneous with composition gradients in its deep interior. However, such formation models typically predict that this region, which could be interpreted as a primordial dilute core, is confined to about 10\% of Jupiter's total mass. In contrast, structure models that fit Juno data imply that this region contains 30\% of the mass or more. One way to explain the origin of this extended region is by invoking a relatively long (about 2 Myrs) formation phase where the growing planet accretes gas and planetesimals delaying the runaway gas accretion. Alternatively, Jupiter's fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact or convection post-formation. These novel scenarios require somewhat special and specific conditions. Clarity on the plausibility of such conditions could come from future high-resolution observations of planet-forming regions around other stars, from the observed and modeled architectures of extrasolar systems with giant planets, and future Juno data obtained during its extended mission.},

  abstract = {The Kepler space telescope has proven capable of detecting transits of objects almost as small as the Earth's Moon. Some studies suggest that moons as small as 0.2 Earth masses can be detected in the Kepler data by transit timing variations and transit duration variations of their host planets. If such massive moons exist around giant planets in the stellar habitable zone (HZ), then they could serve as habitats for extraterrestrial life. While earlier studies on exomoon habitability assumed the host planet to be in thermal equilibrium with the absorbed stellar flux, we here extend this concept by including the planetary luminosity from evolutionary shrinking. Our aim is to assess the danger of exomoons to be in a runaway greenhouse state due to extensive heating from the planet. We apply pre-computed evolution tracks for giant planets to calculate the incident planetary radiation on the moon as a function of time. Added to the stellar flux, the total illumination yields constraints on a moon's habitability. Ultimately, we include tidal heating to evaluate a moon's energy budget. We use a semi-analytical formula to parameterize the critical flux for the moon to experience a runaway greenhouse effect. Planetary illumination from a 13-Jupiter-mass planet onto an Earth-sized moon at a distance of ten Jupiter radii can drive a runaway greenhouse state on the moon for about 200 million years (Myr). When stellar illumination equivalent to that received by Earth from the Sun is added, then the runaway greenhouse holds for about 500~Myr. After 1000~Myr, the planet's habitable edge has moved inward to about six Jupiter radii. Exomoons in orbits with eccentricities of 0.1 experience strong tidal heating; they must orbit a 13-Jupiter-mass host beyond 29 or 18 Jupiter radii after 100~Myr (at the inner and outer boundaries of the stellar HZ, respectively), and beyond 13 Jupiter radii (in both cases) after 1000~Myr to be habitable. If a roughly Earth-sized, Earth-mass moon would be detected in orbit around a giant planet, and if the planet\textendash moon duet would orbit in the stellar HZ, then it will be crucial to recover the orbital history of the moon. If, for example, such a moon around a 13-Jupiter-mass planet has been closer than 20 Jupiter radii to its host during the first few hundred million years at least, then it might have lost substantial amounts of its initial water reservoir and be uninhabitable today.},

  abstract = {In its long-duration observation phase, the PLATO satellite will observe two non-overlapping fields for a total of 4 yr. The exact duration of each pointing will be determined 2 yr before launch. Previous estimates of PLATO's yield of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones (HZs) around solar-type stars ranged between 6 and 280. We use the PLATO Solar-like Light curve Simulator (PSLS) to simulate light curves with transiting planets around bright (m\_V {$>$} 11) Sun-like stars at a cadence of 25 s, roughly representative of the {$>$}15,000 targets in PLATO's high-priority P1 sample (mostly F5-K7 dwarfs and sub-dwarfs). Our study includes light curves generated from synchronous observations of 6, 12, 18, and 24 of PLATO's 12 cm aperture cameras over both 2 yr and 3 yr of continuous observations. Automated detrending is done with the Wotan software and post-detrending transit detection is performed with the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm. We scale the true positive rates (TPRs) with the expected number of stars in the P1 sample and with modern estimates of the exoplanet occurrence rates and predict the detection of planets with 0.5 R\_E {$<$}= R\_p {$<$}= 1.5 R\_E in the HZs around F5-K7 dwarf stars. For the (2 yr + 2 yr) long-duration observation phase strategy we predict 11-34 detections, for the (3 yr + 1 yr) strategy we predict 8-25 discoveries. Our study of the effects of stellar variability on shallow transits of Earth-like planets illustrates that our estimates of PLATO's planet yield, which we derive using a photometrically quiet star like the Sun, must be seen as upper limits. In conclusion, PLATO's detection of about a dozen Earth-sized planets in the HZs around solar-type stars will mean a major contribution to this yet poorly sampled part of the exoplanet parameter space with Earth-like planets.},

  abstract = {Long term precise radial velocity (RV) monitoring of HD206893, as well as anomalies in the system proper motion, have suggested the presence of an additional, inner companion in the system. In this work we describe the results of a search for the companion responsible for this RV drift and proper motion anomaly. Utilizing information from ongoing precision RV measurements with the HARPS spectrograph, as well as Gaia host star astrometry, we have undertaken a multi-epoch search for the purported additional planet using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We report a high significance detection of the purported companion HD206893c over three epochs, with clear evidence for Keplerian orbital motion. Our astrometry with \$\textbackslash sim\$50-100 \$\textbackslash mu\$arcsec precision afforded by GRAVITY allows us to derive a dynamical mass of 12.3\$\^\{+1.1\}\_\{-1.2\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$ and an orbital separation of 3.53\$\^\{+0.80\}\_\{-0.70\}\$ au for HD206893c. Our fits to the orbits of both companions in the system utilize both Gaia astrometry and RVs to also provide a precise dynamical estimate of the previously uncertain mass of the B component, and therefore derive an age of 170 Myr. Importantly, we find that the bolometric luminosity of the newly discovered HD206893c is anomalously high, and that standard cooling curves are unable to simultaneously account for the brightness of both members of the system at a common age of 170 Myr. However, we find that incorporating an elevated helium abundance into our cooling models in turn results in an enhanced level of deuterium burning in the "c" companion, bringing the predicted luminosity in line with our measured value. In addition to utilizing long-term RV information, this effort is an early example of a direct imaging discovery of a bona fide exoplanet that was guided in part with Gaia astrometry.},

While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. As a result of vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most difficult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99\% and 94\% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending methods explored are available for public use in W\=otan, an open-source Python package on GitHub (https://github.com/hippke/wotan).},

  abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 is an 0.09 M{$\odot$} star, which harbours a system of seven Earth-sized planets. Two main features stand out: (i) all planets have similar radii, masses, and compositions; and (ii) all planets are in resonance. Previous works have outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario where planets of similar composition form sequentially at the H2O snowline ({$\sim$}0.1 au for this low-mass star). It was hypothesized that the subsequent formation and migration led to the current resonant configuration. Here, we investigate whether the sequential planet formation model is indeed capable to produce the present-day resonant configuration, characterized by its two-body and three-body mean motion resonances structure. We carry out N-body simulations, accounting for type-I migration, stellar tidal damping, disc eccentricity-damping, and featuring a migration barrier located at the disc's inner edge. Due to the sequential migration, planets naturally form a chain of first-order resonances. But to explain the period ratios of the b/c/d-system, which are presently in higher order resonances, we find that planets b and c must have marched across the migration barrier, into the gas-free cavity, before the disc has dispersed. We investigate both an early and late cavity infall scenario and find that the early infall model best matches the constraints, as well as being more probable. After the dispersal of the gaseous disc, stellar tidal torque also contributes towards a modest separation of the inner system. We outline how the insights obtained in this work can be applied to aid the understanding of other compact resonant planet systems.},

We find a total of 11 planets with mass ratios q {$<$} 2 \texttimes{} 10-4, including 6 newly discovered planets, 1 planet that was reported in Paper I, and recovery of 4 previously discovered planets. One of the new planets, OGLE-2018-BLG-0977Lb, is in a planetary caustic event, while the other five (OGLE-2018-BLG-0506Lb, OGLE-2018-BLG-0516Lb, OGLE-2019-BLG-1492Lb, KMT-2019-BLG-0253, and KMT-2019-BLG-0953) are revealed by a ``dip'' in the light curve as the source crosses the host-planet axis on the opposite side of the planet. These subtle signals were missed in previous by-eye searches. The planet-host separations (scaled to the Einstein radius), s, and planet-host mass ratios, q, are, respectively, (s, q \texttimes{} 105) = (0.88, 4.1), (0.96 {$\pm$} 0.10, 8.3), (0.94 {$\pm$} 0.07, 13), (0.97 {$\pm$} 0.07, 18), (0.97 {$\pm$} 0.04, 4.1), and (0.74, 18), where the `` {$\pm$} '' indicates a discrete degeneracy. The 11 planets are spread out over the range . Together with the two planets previously reported with q {$\sim$} 10-5 from the 2018\textendash 2019 nonprime KMT fields, this result suggests that planets toward the bottom of this mass-ratio range may be more common than previously believed.},

Water ocean mass is determined as a result not only of water delivery and loss, but also of water partitioning among several reservoirs. Here we review our current understanding of water partitioning among the atmosphere, magma ocean, and solid mantle of accreting planetary embryos and protoplanets just after giant collisions. Magma oceans are readily formed in planetary embryos and protoplanets in their accretion phase. Significant amounts of water are partitioned into magma oceans, provided the planetary building blocks are water-rich enough. Particularly important but still quite uncertain issues are how much water the planetary building blocks contain initially and how water goes out of the solidifying mantle and is finally degassed to the atmosphere. Constraints from both solar-system explorations and exoplanet observations and also from laboratory experiments are needed to resolve these issues.},

Equilibrium therefore requires that the condensed phase evaporates into the atmosphere.Moist adiabatic and pseudoadiabatic atmospheres in which the condensing vapor is a major atmospheric constituent are considered. This situation would apply if the solar constant were supercritical with respect to an abundant substance such as water. It is shown that the condensing gas would be a major constituent at all levels in such an atmosphere. Photodissociation of water in the primordial Venus atmosphere is discussed in this context.},

This radius valley separates two classes of planets -- usually referred to as "super-Earths" and "mini-Neptunes" -- and its origin remains debated. One model proposes that super-Earths are the outcome of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass-loss stripping the primordial atmospheres of the mini-Neptunes. A contrasting model interprets the radius valley as a dichotomy in the bulk compositions, where super-Earths are rocky planets and mini-Neptunes are water-ice rich worlds. In this work, we test whether the migration model is consistent with the radius valley and how it distinguishes these views. In the migration model, planets migrate towards the disk inner edge forming a chain of planets locked in resonant configurations. After the gas disk dispersal, orbital instabilities "break the chains" and promote late collisions. This model broadly matches the period-ratio and planet-multiplicity distributions of Kepler planets, and accounts for resonant chains such as TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-223, and TOI-178. Here, by combining the outcome of planet formation simulations with compositional mass-radius relationships, and assuming complete loss of primordial H-rich atmospheres in late giant-impacts, we show that the migration model accounts for the exoplanet radius valley and the intra-system uniformity ("peas-in-a-pod") of Kepler planets. Our results suggest that planets with sizes of \$\textbackslash sim\$1.4 \$R\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ are mostly rocky, whereas those with sizes of \$\textbackslash sim\$2.4 \$R\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ are mostly water-ice rich worlds. Our results do not support an exclusively rocky composition for the cores of mini-Neptunes.},

  abstract = {Active comets have been detected in several exoplanetary systems, although so far only indirectly, when the dust or gas in the extended coma has transited in front of the stellar disk. The large optical surface and relatively high temperature of an active cometary coma also makes it suitable to study with direct imaging, but the angular separation is generally too small to be reachable with present-day facilities. However, future imaging facilities with the ability to detect terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of nearby systems will also be sensitive to exocomets in such systems. Here we examine several aspects of exocomet imaging, particularly in the context of the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE), which is a proposed space mission for infrared imaging and spectroscopy through nulling interferometry. We study what capabilities LIFE would have for acquiring imaging and spectroscopy of exocomets, based on simulations of the LIFE performance as well as statistical properties of exocomets that have recently been deduced from transit surveys. We find that for systems with extreme cometary activities such as beta Pictoris, sufficiently bright comets may be so abundant that they overcrowd the LIFE inner field of view. More nearby and moderately active systems such as epsilon Eridani or Fomalhaut may turn out to be optimal targets. If the exocomets have strong silicate emission features, such as in comet Hale-Bopp, it may become possible to study the mineralogy of individual exocometary bodies. We also discuss the possibility of exocomets as false positives for planets, with recent deep imaging of alpha Centauri as one hypothetical example. Such contaminants could be common, primarily among young debris disk stars, but should be rare among the main sequence population. We discuss strategies to mitigate the risk of any such false positives.},

However, mysteries still remain, partly due to bias and uncertainty of the current observational data sets and partly due to the fact that theoretical models for the formation and evolution of planetary systems are still underdeveloped. In this study, we calculate the spin angular momentum of host stars and the orbital angular momentum of their planets using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive along with detailed analysis of observation dependent biases and uncertainty ranges. We also analyze the angular momentum of the planetary system as a function of star age to understand their variation in different evolutionary stages. In addition, we use a population of planets from theoretical model simulations to reexamine the observed patterns and compare the simulated population with the observed samples to assess variations and differences. We found the majority of exoplanets discovered thus far do not have the angular momentum distribution similar to that of planets in our solar system, though this could be due to the observation bias. When filtered by the observational biases, the model simulated angular momentum distributions are comparable to the observed pattern in general. However, the differences between the observation and model simulation in the parameter (angular momentum) space provide more rigorous constraints and insights on the issues that needed future improvement.},

We find that the population-wide imprints like the location of the "evaporation valley" in the distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution clearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with the observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in low-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition. Combined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that low-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still undergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets losing all primordial H/He. For planets in this "triangle of evaporation" in the distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced. In the observed diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with increasing radius (R/R\_Earth\textbackslash textless1.6 rocky; 1.6-3.0 ices and/or H/He; \textbackslash textgreater3: H/He). The mass-density diagram contains important information about formation and evolution. Its characteristic broken V-shape reveals the transitions from solid planets to low-mass core-dominated planets with H/He and finally to gas-dominated giants. Evaporation causes density and orbital distance to be anti-correlated for low-mass planets, in contrast to giants, where closer-in planets are less dense, likely due to inflation. The temporal evolution of the statistical properties reported here will be of interest for the PLATO 2.0 mission which will observe the temporal dimension.},

  abstract = {The pathway to forming the iron-rich planet Mercury remains mysterious. Mercury's core makes up 70\% of the planetary mass, which implies a significant enrichment of iron relative to silicates, while its mantle is strongly depleted in oxidized iron. The high core mass fraction is traditionally ascribed to evaporative loss of silicates, e.g. following a giant impact, but the high abundance of moderately volatile elements in the mantle of Mercury is inconsistent with reaching temperatures much above 1,000 K during its formation. Here we explore the nucleation of solid particles from a gas of solar composition that cools down in the hot inner regions of the protoplanetary disc. The high surface tension of iron causes iron particles to nucleate homogeneously (i.e., not on a more refractory substrate) under very high supersaturation. The low nucleation rates lead to depositional growth of large iron pebbles on a sparse population of nucleated iron nano-particles. Silicates in the form of iron-free MgSiO\$\_3\$ nucleate at similar temperatures but obtain smaller sizes due to the much higher number of nucleated particles. This results in a chemical separation of large iron particles from silicate particles with ten times lower Stokes numbers. We propose that such conditions lead to the formation of iron-rich planetesimals by the streaming instability. In this view, Mercury formed by accretion of iron-rich planetesimals with a sub-solar abundance of highly reduced silicate material. Our results imply that the iron-rich planets known to orbit the Sun and other stars are not required to have experienced mantle-stripping impacts. Instead their formation could be a direct consequence of temperature fluctuations in protoplanetary discs and chemical separation of distinct crystal species through the ensuing nucleation process.},

  abstract = {We present stellar and planetary properties for 1305 Kepler Objects of Interest hosting 2025 planet candidates observed as part of the California-Kepler Survey. We combine spectroscopic constraints, presented in Paper I, with stellar interior modeling to estimate stellar masses, radii, and ages. Stellar radii are typically constrained to 11\%, compared to 40\% when only photometric constraints are used. Stellar masses are constrained to 4\%, and ages are constrained to 30\%. We verify the integrity of the stellar parameters through comparisons with asteroseismic studies and Gaia parallaxes. We also recompute planetary radii for 2025 planet candidates. Because knowledge of planetary radii is often limited by uncertainties in stellar size, we improve the uncertainties in planet radii from typically 42\% to 12\%. We also leverage improved knowledge of stellar effective temperature to recompute incident stellar fluxes for the planets, now precise to 21\%, compared to a factor of two when derived from photometry.},

  abstract = {The relative rarity of giant planets around low-mass stars compared with solar-type stars is a key prediction from the core-accretion planet formation theory. In this paper we report on the discovery of four gas giant planets that transit low-mass late K and early M dwarfs. The planets HATS-74Ab (TOI 737b), HATS-75b (TOI 552b), HATS-76b (TOI 555b), and HATS-77b (TOI 730b) were all discovered from the HATSouth photometric survey and follow-up using TESS and other photometric facilities. We use the new ESPRESSO facility at the VLT to confirm systems and measure their masses. We find that these planets have masses of 1.46 {$\pm$} 0.14 MJ, 0.491 {$\pm$} 0.039 MJ, 2.629 {$\pm$} 0.089 MJ, and MJ, respectively, and radii of 1.032 {$\pm$} 0.021 RJ, 0.884 {$\pm$} 0.013 RJ, 1.079 {$\pm$} 0.031 RJ, and 1.165 {$\pm$} 0.021 RJ, respectively. The planets all orbit close to their host stars with orbital periods ranging from 1.7319 days to 3.0876 days. With further work, we aim to test core-accretion theory by using these and further discoveries to quantify the occurrence rate of giant planets around low-mass host stars.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (i.e., elements heavier than helium, also called "metallicity"), and thus formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2 but have not yielded definitive detections due to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Program (ERS). The data used in this study span 3.0 to 5.5 \{\textbackslash mu\}m in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3 \{\textbackslash mu\}m (26\{\textbackslash sigma\} significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, 10x solar metallicity models that assume radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 \{\textbackslash mu\}m that is not reproduced by these models.},

Our yield estimates are based on recently derived rocky planet occurrence rates from the Kepler mission and our LIFE exoplanet observation simulation tool LIFEsim, which includes all major astrophysical noise sources, but no instrumental noise sources, yet. Depending on a pessimistic or optimistic extrapolation of the Kepler results, we find that during a 2.5-year search phase LIFE could detect between \textasciitilde 10-16 (average) or \textasciitilde 5-34 (including 1-\$\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainties) rocky planets (0.5-1.5 R\$\{\}\_\textbackslash rm\{Earth\}\$) within the optimistic HZ of Sun-like stars and between \textasciitilde 4-6 (average) or \textasciitilde 1-13 (including 1-\$\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainties) exo-Earth candidates (EECs) assuming four collector spacecraft equipped with 2 m mirrors and a conservative instrument throughput of 5\%. With D=3.5 m or 1 m mirrors, the yield \$Y\$ changes strongly following approximately \$Y \textbackslash propto D\^\{3/2\}\$. With the larger sample of FGK-type stars, the yield increases to \textasciitilde 16-22 (average) rocky planets within the optimistic HZ and \textasciitilde 5-8 (average) EECs. Furthermore, we find that, besides the mirror diameter, the yield depends strongly on the total throughput, but only weakly on the exozodiacal dust level and the accessible wavelength range of the mission. When focusing entirely on Sun-like stars, larger mirrors (\textasciitilde 3 m with 5\% total throughput) or a better total throughput (\textasciitilde 20\% with 2 m mirrors) are required to detect a statistically relevant sample of \textasciitilde 30 rocky planets within the optimistic HZ.},

Such discoveries have been a key feature of results from the Kepler mission which utilizes the transit method to determine the size of the planet. These discoveries have resulted in a corresponding interest in the topic of the Habitable Zone and the search for potential Earth analogs. Within the solar system, there is a clear dichotomy between Venus and Earth in terms of atmospheric evolution, likely the result of the large difference (approximately a factor of two) in incident flux from the Sun. Since Venus is 95\% of the Earth's radius in size, it is impossible to distinguish between these two planets based only on size. In this Letter we discuss planetary insolation in the context of atmospheric erosion and runaway greenhouse limits for planets similar to Venus. We define a ``Venus Zone'' in which the planet is more likely to be a Venus analog rather than an Earth analog. We identify 43 potential Venus analogs with an occurrence rate ({$\eta\female$}) of and for M dwarfs and GK dwarfs, respectively.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to study the response of an Earth-like atmosphere to large increases in solar flux. For fully saturated, cloud-free conditions, the critical solar flux at which a runaway greenhouse occurs, that is, the oceans evaporate entirely, is found to be 1.4 times the present flux at Earth's orbit (S0). This value is close to the flux expected at Venus' orbit early in solar system history. It is nearly independent of the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere, but is sensitive to the H2O absorption coefficient in the 8- to 12-{$\mu$}m window region. Clouds should tend to depress the surface temperature on a warm, moist planet; thus, Venus may originally have had oceans if its initial water endowment was close to that of Earth. It lost them early in its history, however, because of rapid photodissociation of water vapor followed by escape of hydrogen to space. The critical solar flux above which water is rapidly lost could be as low as 1.1S0. The surface temperature of a runaway greenhouse atmosphere containing a full ocean's worth of water would have been in excess of 1500\textdegree K\textemdash above the solidus for silicate rocks. The presence of such a steam atmosphere during accretion may have significantly influenced the early thermal evolution of both Earth and Venus.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

The probability that a given star has at least one gas giant increases linearly with stellar mass from 0.4 to 3 M{$\Sun$}. Stars more massive than 3 M{$\Sun$} evolve quickly to the main sequence, which pushes the snow line to 10-15 AU before protoplanets form and limits the range of disk masses that form giant planet cores.

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Planetary migration is a key link between planet formation models and observed exoplanet statistics. So far, the theory of planetary migration has focused on the interaction of one or more planets with an inviscid or viscously evolving gaseous disk. Turbulent viscosity is thought to be the main driver of the secular evolution of the disk, and it is known to affect the migration process for intermediate- to high-mass planets. Recently, however, the topic of wind-driven accretion has experienced a renaissance because evidence is mounting that protoplanetary disks may be less turbulent than previously thought, and 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic modeling of the wind-launching process is maturing.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We investigate how wind-driven accretion may affect planetary migration. We aim for a qualitative exploration of the main effects and not for a quantitative prediction.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We performed 2D hydrodynamic planet-disk interaction simulations with the FARGO3D code in the (\emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{{$\phi<$}i/{$>$}) plane. The vertical coordinate in the disk and the launching of the wind are not treated explicitly. Instead, the torque caused by the wind onto the disk is treated using a simple two-parameter formula. The parameters are the wind mass-loss rate and the lever arm.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that the wind-driven accretion process replenishes the co-orbital region in a different way than the viscous accretion process. The former always injects mass from the outer edge of the co-orbital region, and always removes mass from the inner edge, while the latter injects or removes mass from the co-orbital region depending on the radial density gradients in the disk. As a consequence, the migration behavior can differ strongly, and can under certain conditions drive rapid type-III-like outward migration. We derive an analytic expression for the parameters under which this outward migration occurs.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} If wind-driven accretion plays a role in the secular evolution of protoplanetary disks, planetary migration studies have to include this process as well because it can strongly affect the resulting migration rate and migration direction.}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Exoplanet surveys around M dwarfs have detected a growing number of exoplanets with Earth-like insolation. It is expected that some of those planets are rocky planets with the potential for temperate climates favourable to surface liquid water. However, various models predict that terrestrial planets orbiting in the classical habitable zone around M dwarfs have no water or too much water, suggesting that habitable planets around M dwarfs might be rare. Here we present the results of an updated planetary population synthesis model, which includes the effects of water enrichment in the primordial atmosphere, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric hydrogen by rocky materials from incoming planetesimals and from the magma ocean. We find that this water production in the primordial atmosphere is found to significantly impact the occurrence of terrestrial rocky aqua planets, yielding ones with diverse water content. We estimate that 5\textendash 10\% of the planets with a size of {$<$}1.3R{$\oplus$} orbiting early-to-mid M dwarfs have appropriate amounts of seawater for habitability. Such an occurrence rate would be high enough to detect potentially habitable planets by ongoing and near-future M-dwarf planet survey missions.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets is well described by the Beta distribution. Several properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867\$\{\^\{+ 0.044\}\_\{- 0.044\}\}\$ and b = 3.03\$\{\^\{+ 0.17\}\_\{- 0.16\}\}\$. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7~times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the Beta distribution, where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct Beta distributions at a confidence of 11.6{$\sigma$} and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.},

By application of Bayes' theorem, we reverse this logic to show that the eccentricity distribution of transiting planets is positively biased. Adopting the flexible Beta distribution as the underlying prior for eccentricity, we derive the marginalized transit probability as well as the a priori joint probability distribution of eccentricity and argument of periastron, given that a planet is known to transit. These results allow us to demonstrate that most planet occurrence rate calculations using Kepler data have overestimated the prevalence of planets by~{$\sim$}10 per cent. Indeed, the true occurrence of planets from transit surveys is fundamentally intractable without a prior assumption for the eccentricity distribution. Further more, we show that previously extracted eccentricity distributions using Kepler data are positively biased. In cases where one wishes to impose an informative eccentricity prior, we provide a recursive algorithm to apply inverse transform sampling of our joint prior probability distribution. Computer code of this algorithm, ECCSAMPLES, is provided to enable the community to sample directly from the prior (availablehere).},

Anticorrelated TTVs are clearly evident indicating that the transiters orbit the same star and interact via a near 2:1 mean motion resonance.

TOI-216 lies close to the southern ecliptic pole and thus will be observed by TESS throughout the first year, providing an opportunity for continuous dynamical monitoring and considerable refinement of the dynamical masses presented here. TOI-216 closely resembles Kepler-9 in architecture, and we hypothesize that in such systems these Saturn analogues failed to fully open a gap and thus migrated far deeper into the system before becoming trapped into resonance, which would imply that future detections of new analogues may also have sub-Jupiter masses.},

As these assessments have typically excluded the contribution of astronomical research infrastructures, we complement these studies by providing an estimate of the contribution of astronomical space missions and ground-based observatories using greenhouse gas emission factors that relates cost and payload mass to carbon footprint. We find that worldwide active astronomical research infrastructures currently have a carbon footprint of 20.3\,{$\pm$}\,3.3\,MtCO2 equivalent (CO2e) and an annual emission of 1,169\,{$\pm$}\,249\,ktCO2e\,yr-1 corresponding to a footprint of 36.6\,{$\pm$}\,14.0\,tCO2e\,per year\,per astronomer. Compared with contributions from other aspects of astronomy research activity, our results suggest that research infrastructures make the single largest contribution to the carbon footprint of an astronomer. We discuss the limitations and uncertainties of our method and explore measures that can bring greenhouse gas emissions from astronomical research infrastructures towards a sustainable level.},

Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great promise.

Concepts for optimized space missions to overcome these challenges are being studied. The LIFE initiative focuses on the development of a space-based mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometer probing the thermal emission of a large sample of exoplanets. We derive first estimates for the signal-to-noise (S/N), spectral resolution (R), and wavelength requirements for LIFE. Using an Earth-twin exoplanet as reference case, we quantify how well planetary/atmospheric properties can be constrained from MIR spectra of different quality. We simulate LIFE observations of an Earth-twin orbiting a G2V star at 10 pc from the Sun with different levels of exozodiacal dust emissions. We combine a cloud-free 1D radiative transfer model and the nested sampling algorithm to retrieve planetary/atmospheric properties from input spectra of different wavelength coverage, R, and S/N. We find that H2O, CO2, and O3 are detectable if S/N\$\textbackslash geq\$10 (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm1.0\$ dex). We find upper limits for N2O (abundance \$\textbackslash leq10\^\{-3\}\$). CO, N2, and O2 are unconstrained in all cases. The limit for a CH4 detection is R \$= 50\$, S/N \$=10\$. We further correctly determine the exoplanet radius (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm10\textbackslash\%\$), surface temperature (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm20\$K), and surface pressure (uncertainty \$\textbackslash leq\textbackslash pm0.5\$ dex). With the current LIFE design, the observation time required to reach the specified S/N amounts to \$\textbackslash sim7\$ weeks with 4x2m apertures. We conclude that a minimum wavelength coverage of \$4-18.5\textbackslash mu\$m, a R of 50 and an S/N of 10 is required. With the current assumptions, the atmospheric characterization of several Earth-like exoplanets at a distance of 10 pc and within a reasonable amount of observing time will require apertures \$\textbackslash geq2\$ meters.},

  abstract = {Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95\textendash 1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative\textendash convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H2O and CO2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with Teff {$\lessequivlnt$} 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on {$\eta\oplus$}, so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.},

In this Letter, we present estimates of habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective temperatures in the range 2600 K\textendash 7200 K, for planetary masses between 0.1 M{$\oplus$} and 5 M{$\oplus$}. Assuming H2O-(inner HZ) and CO2-(outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and scaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, our results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones. Specifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense atmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward ({$\sim$}10\% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse effect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O column depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge moves inward ({$\sim$}7\% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to the competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New, three-dimensional climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue that further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions. Combined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined estimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step toward a more comprehensive analysis of HZs.},

We propose here a classification scheme that distinguishes exoplanets into different categories based on their size and incident stellar flux, for the purpose of providing the expected number of exoplanets observed (yield) with direct imaging missions. The boundaries of this classification can be computed using the known chemical behavior of gases and condensates at different pressures and temperatures in a planetary atmosphere. In this study, we initially focus on condensation curves for sphalerite ZnS, , , and . The order in which these species condense in a planetary atmosphere define the boundaries between different classes of planets. Broadly, the planets are divided into rocky planets (0.5\textendash 1.0 R{$\oplus$}), super-Earths (1.0\textendash 1.75 R{$\oplus$}), sub-Neptunes (1.75\textendash 3.5 R{$\oplus$}), sub-Jovians (3.5\textendash 6.0 R{$\oplus$}), and Jovians (6\textendash 14.3 R{$\oplus$}) based on their planet sizes, and ``hot,'' ``warm,'' and ``cold'' based on the incident stellar flux. We then calculate planet occurrence rates within these boundaries for different kinds of exoplanets, {$\eta$}planet, using the community coordinated results of NASA's Exoplanet Program Analysis Group's Science Analysis Group-13 (SAG-13). These occurrence rate estimates are in turn used to estimate the expected exoplanet yields for direct imaging missions of different telescope diameters.},

When combined with the astrometric data, these allow us to derive orbital and stellar parameters that are key in order to understand the stellar populations of the Milky Way and perform galactic archaeology. We use the calibrated atmospheric parameters, 2MASS and Gaia-EDR3 photometry, and parallax-based distances to compute, via an isochrone fitting method, the ages, initial stellar masses and reddenings for the stars with spectroscopic parameters. We also derive the orbits (actions, eccentricities, apocentre, pericentre and Zmax) for all of the stars with measured radial velocities and astrometry, adopting two sets of line-of-sight distances from the literature and an axisymmetric potential of the Galaxy. Comparisons with reference catalogues of field and cluster stars suggest that reliable ages are obtained for stars younger than 9-10Gyr when the estimated relative age uncertainty is {$<$}50\%. For older stars, ages tend to be under-estimated. The most reliable stellar type for age determination are turn-off stars, even when the input atmospheric parameters have large uncertainties. Ages for giants and main-sequence stars are retrieved with uncertainties of \textasciitilde 2Gyr when extinction towards the star's line-of sight is smaller than A\_V{$<$}2.5mag. The full catalogue is made publicly available to be downloaded.

Sitting at a separation of \$0.0672\textbackslash pm0.0014\$au away from the host star puts Wolf 1069b in the habitable zone (HZ), receiving an incident flux of \$S=0.652\textbackslash pm0.029S\_\textbackslash oplus\$. The planetary signal was detected using telluric-corrected radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES spectrograph, amounting to a total of 262 spectroscopic observations covering almost four years. There are additional long-period signals in the RVs, one of which we attribute to the stellar rotation period. This is possible thanks to our photometric analysis including new, well-sampled monitoring campaigns undergone with the OSN and TJO facilities that supplement archival photometry (i.e., from MEarth and SuperWASP), and this yielded an updated rotational period range of \$P\_\{rot\}=150-170\$d, with a likely value at \$169.3\^\{+3.7\}\_\{-3.6\}\$d. The stellar activity indicators provided by the CARMENES spectra likewise demonstrate evidence for the slow rotation period, though not as accurately due to possible factors such as signal aliasing or spot evolution. Our detectability limits indicate that additional planets more massive than one Earth mass with orbital periods of less than 10 days can be ruled out, suggesting that perhaps Wolf 1069 b had a violent formation history. This planet is also the 6th closest Earth-mass planet situated in the conservative HZ, after Proxima Centauri b, GJ 1061d, Teegarden's Star c, and GJ 1002 b and c. Despite not transiting, Wolf 1069b is nonetheless a very promising target for future three-dimensional climate models to investigate various habitability cases as well as for sub-ms\$\^\{-1\}\$ RV campaigns to search for potential inner sub-Earth-mass planets in order to test planet formation theories.},

  abstract = {Recent direct imaging discoveries suggest a new class of massive, distant planets around A stars. These widely separated giants have been interpreted as signs of planet formation driven by gravitational instability, but the viability of this mechanism is not clear-cut. In this paper, we first discuss the local requirements for fragmentation and the initial fragment mass scales. We then consider whether the fragment's subsequent growth can be terminated within the planetary mass regime. Finally, we place disks in the larger context of star formation and disk evolution models. We find that in order for gravitational instability to produce planets, disks must be atypically cold in order to reduce the initial fragment mass. In addition, fragmentation must occur during a narrow window of disk evolution, after infall has mostly ceased, but while the disk is still sufficiently massive to undergo gravitational instability. Under more typical conditions, disk-born objects will likely grow well above the deuterium burning planetary mass limit. We conclude that if planets are formed by gravitational instability, they must be the low-mass tail of the distribution of disk-born companions. To validate this theory, ongoing direct imaging surveys must find a greater abundance of brown dwarf and M-star companions to A stars. Their absence would suggest planet formation by a different mechanism such as core accretion, which is consistent with the debris disks detected in these systems. \textcopyright{} 2010.

Given the universality of physics and chemistry, not least the ubiquity of water as a solvent and carbon as a backbone of complex molecules, CHNOPS are likely crucial to most habitable worlds. To help guide and inform the search for potentially habitable and ultimately inhabited environments, we begin by summarizing the CHNOPS budget of various reservoirs on Earth, their role in shaping our biosphere, and their origins in the Solar Nebula. We then synthesize our current understanding of how these elements behave and are distributed in diverse astrophysical settings, tracing their journeys from synthesis in dying stars to molecular clouds, protoplanetary settings, and ultimately temperate rocky planets around main sequence stars. We end by identifying key branching points during this journey, highlighting instances where a forming planets' distribution of CHNOPS can be altered dramatically, and speculating about the consequences for the chemical habitability of these worlds.},

  abstract = {The search for life on exoplanets is motivated by the universal ways in which life could modify its planetary environment. Atmospheric gases such as oxygen and methane are promising candidates for such environmental modification due to the evolutionary benefits their production would confer. However, confirming that these gases are produced by life, rather than by geochemical or astrophysical processes, will require a thorough understanding of planetary context, including the expected counterfactual atmospheric evolution for lifeless planets. Here, we evaluate current understanding of planetary context for several candidate biosignatures and their upcoming observability. We review the contextual framework for oxygen and describe how conjectured abiotic oxygen scenarios may be testable. In contrast to oxygen, current understanding of how planetary context controls non-biological methane (CH4) production is limited, even though CH4 biosignatures in anoxic atmospheres may be readily detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess environmental context for CH4 biosignatures and conclude that abundant atmospheric CH4 coexisting with CO2, and CO:CH4 {$\ll$} 1 is suggestive of biological production, although precise thresholds are dependent on stellar context and sparsely characterized abiotic CH4 scenarios. A planetary context framework is also considered for alternative or agnostic biosignatures. Whatever the distribution of life in the Universe, observations of terrestrial exoplanets in coming decades will provide a quantitative understanding of the atmospheric evolution of lifeless worlds. This knowledge will inform future instrument requirements to either corroborate the presence of life elsewhere or confirm its apparent absence.},

  abstract = {We study the initial development, structure and evolution of protoplanetary clumps formed in 3D resistive MHD simulations of self-gravitating disks. The magnetic field grows by means of the recently identified gravitational instability dynamo (Riols \&amp; Latter 2018; Deng et al. 2020). Clumps are identified and their evolution is tracked finely both backward and forward in time. Their properties and evolutionary path is compared to clumps in companion simulations without magnetic fields. We find that magnetic and rotational energy are important in the clumps' outer regions, while in the cores, despite appreciable magnetic field amplification, thermal pressure is most important in counteracting gravity. Turbulent kinetic energy is of a smaller scale than magnetic energy in the clumps. Compared to non-magnetized clumps, rotation is less prominent, which results in lower angular momentum in much better agreement with observations. In order to understand the very low sub-Jovian masses of clumps forming in MHD simulations, we revisit the perturbation theory of magnetized sheets finding support for a previously proposed magnetic destabilization in low-shear regions. This can help explaining why fragmentation ensues on a scale more than an order of magnitude smaller than that of the Toomre mass. The smaller fragmentation scale and the high magnetic pressure in clumps' envelopes explain why clumps in magnetized disks are typically in the super-Earth to Neptune mass regime rather than Super-Jupiters as in conventional disk instability. Our findings put forward a viable alternative to core accretion to explain widespread formation of intermediate-mass planets.},

  abstract = {Various interactions affect the population of close-in planets. Among them, the tidal and magnetic interactions drive orbital decay and star-planet angular momentum exchange, leading to stellar spin-up. As a result of the above processes, a planet may initiate the mass transfer to the host star once it encounters the Roche limit. Another mechanism providing substantial mass loss is associated with the atmospheric escape caused by photoevaporation followed by orbital expansion, which is thought to be important for hot Neptunes and super-Earths. Thus, the fraction of the initial number of hot Jupiters may transform into lower-mass planets through the Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) phase and continue secular evolution under the effect of photoevaporation. In the present paper, we compile the latest prescriptions for tidal and magnetic migration and mass-loss rates to explore the dynamics of hot Jupiter systems. We study how the implemented interactions shape the orbital architecture of Jovian planets and whether their impact is enough to reproduce the observational sample. Our models suggest that the tidal interaction is able to generate the upper boundary of the hot Jupiter population in the mass-separation diagram. To recreate the sub-Jovian desert, we need to make additional assumptions regarding the RLO phase or the influence of the protoplanetary disc's inner edge on the initial planetary location. According to our estimates, 12-15\% of hot Jupiters around solar-mass stars have been engulfed or become lower-mass planets. 0.20-0.25\% of the present-day giant planet population undergoes decay intense enough to be detected with modern facilities.},

Through the water-mediated carbonate-silicate weathering cycle, atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) responds to changes in surface temperature, stabilizing the climate over geologic timescales. We show that this weathering feedback ought to produce a log-linear relationship between pCO2 and incident flux on Earth-like planets in the HZ. However, this trend has scatter because geophysical and physicochemical parameters can vary, such as land area for weathering and CO2 outgassing fluxes. Using a coupled climate and carbonate-silicate weathering model, we quantify the likely scatter in pCO2 with orbital distance throughout the HZ. From this dispersion, we predict a two-dimensional relationship between incident flux and pCO2 in the HZ and show that it could be detected from at least 83 (2{$\sigma$}) Earth-like exoplanet observations. If fewer Earth-like exoplanets are observed, testing the HZ hypothesis from this relationship could be difficult.},

  abstract = {We address a recently posed question: `Why Do So Many Astronomy (and Astrobiology) Discoveries Fail to Live Up to the Hype?' We expand it to cover hype within science in general. Our answer relies on working definitions of hype and skin in the game, as applied to research science, and a game theory model for the stability of cooperative science. Low skin in the game allows internal feedbacks, within the research science community, to initiate increased hype and a drift toward structural instability. The instability leads to the deterioration of cooperative equilibria, which further enhances hype. Along the drift, the number of results hyped as breakthroughs will increase and more claims will fail to live up to the hype. This can lead to the public perception that science is moving backwards and a shift in the perception of what scientists, and science, values. Although a hype instability can be initiated by external nudges, a bigger role is played by the internal dynamics of the system, i.e. the collective of working scientists. Corrections for a drift toward instability should, likewise, focus on internal structure. Proposed external shifts on how research is disseminated will add restrictions to a system that can do more harm than good.},

However, the distribution of compositionally Earth-like planets remains insufficiently constrained3, and it is not clear whether the Solar System is a statistical outlier or can be explained by more general planetary formation processes. Here we use numerical models of planet formation, evolution and interior structure to show that a planet's bulk water fraction and radius are anti-correlated with initial 26Al levels in the planetesimal-based accretion framework. The heat generated by this short-lived radionuclide rapidly dehydrates planetesimals8 before their accretion onto larger protoplanets and yields a system-wide correlation9,10 of planetary bulk water abundances, which, for instance, can explain the lack of a clear orbital trend in the water budgets of the TRAPPIST-1 planets11. Qualitatively, our models suggest two main scenarios for the formation of planetary systems: high-26Al systems, like our Solar System, form small, water-depleted planets, whereas those devoid of 26Al predominantly form ocean worlds. For planets of similar mass, the mean planetary transit radii of the ocean planet population can be up to about 10\% larger than for planets from the 26Al-rich formation scenario.},

The global efficacy of these mechanisms, however, hinges on the transfer of reduced iron from the molten silicate mantle to the metal core. Scaling analysis indicates that turbulent diffusion in the internal magma oceans of sub-Neptunes can kinetically entrain liquid iron droplets and quench core formation. This suggests that the chemical equilibration between core, mantle, and atmosphere may be energetically limited by convective overturn in the magma flow. Hence, molten super-Earths possibly retain a compositional memory of their accretion path. Redox control by magma ocean circulation is positively correlated with planetary heat flow, internal gravity, and planet size. The presence and speciation of remanent atmospheres, surface mineralogy, and core mass fraction of primary envelope-stripped exoplanets may thus constrain magma ocean dynamics.},

Our simulations demonstrate that disk chemistry and degassing from planetesimals operate on comparable timescales and can fractionate the relative abundances of major water and carbon carriers by orders of magnitude. As a result, individual planetary systems with significant planetesimal processing display increased correlation in the volatile budget of planetary building blocks relative to no internal heating. Planetesimal processing in a subset of systems increases the variance of volatile contents across planetary systems. Our simulations thus suggest that exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may provide constraints on when a specific planet formed.},

While geochemical evidence supports a dry, highly reduced late veneer on Earth, the composition of late-impacting debris around lower-mass stars is subject to variable volatile loss as a result of their hosts' extended pre-main sequence phase. We perform simulations of late-stage planet formation across the M-dwarf mass spectrum to derive upper limits on reducing bombardment epochs in Hadean analog environments. We contrast the Solar System scenario with varying initial volatile distributions due to extended primordial runaway greenhouse phases on protoplanets and desiccation of smaller planetesimals by internal radiogenic heating. We find a decreasing rate of late-accreting reducing impacts with decreasing stellar mass. Young planets around stars \$\textbackslash leq\$ 0.4 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ experience no impacts of sufficient mass to generate prebiotically relevant concentrations of reduced atmospheric compounds once their stars have reached the main sequence. For M-dwarf planets to not exceed Earth-like concentrations of volatiles, both planetesimals and larger protoplanets must undergo extensive devolatilization processes and can typically emerge from long-lived magma ocean phases with sufficient atmophile content to outgas secondary atmospheres. Our results suggest that transiently reducing surface conditions on young rocky exoplanets are favoured around FGK- stellar types relative to M-dwarfs.},

For this purpose, the photometric data of 40 nearby ultra-cool dwarfs were reanalysed in a self-consistent and fully automated manner starting from the raw images. The pipeline developed specifically for this task generates differential light curves, removes non-planetary photometric features and stellar variability, and searches for transits. It identifies the transits of TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c without any human intervention. To test the pipeline and the potential output of similar surveys, we injected planetary transits into the light curves on a star-by-star basis and tested whether the pipeline is able to detect them. The achieved photometric precision enables us to identify Earth-sized planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs as validated by the injection tests. Our planet-injection simulation further suggests a lower limit of 10 per cent on the occurrence rate of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1b with a radius between 1 and 1.3 \$R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ and the orbital period between 1.4 and 1.8 days.},

However, the instability trigger and timing have not been clearly established5\textendash 9. Hydrodynamical modelling has shown that while the Sun's gaseous protoplanetary disk was present the giant planets migrated into a compact orbital configuration in a chain of resonances2,10. Here we use dynamical simulations to show that the giant planets' instability was probably triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. As the disk evaporated from the inside out, its inner edge swept successively across and dynamically perturbed each planet's orbit in turn. The associated orbital shift caused a dynamical compression of the exterior part of the system, ultimately triggering instability. The final orbits of our simulated systems match those of the Solar System for a viable range of astrophysical parameters. The giant planet instability therefore took place as the gaseous disk dissipated, constrained by astronomical observations to be a few to ten million years after the birth of the Solar System11. Terrestrial planet formation would not complete until after such an early giant planet instability12,13; the growing terrestrial planets may even have been sculpted by its perturbations, explaining the small mass of Mars relative to Earth14.},

  abstract = {Rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are among the most promising and abundant astronomical targets for detecting habitable climates. Planets in the M-dwarf habitable zone are likely synchronously rotating, such that we expect significant day-night temperature differences, and potentially limited fractional habitability. Previous studies have focused on scenarios where fractional habitability is confined to the substellar or "eye" region, but in this paper we explore the possibility of planets with terminator habitability, defined by the existence of a habitable band at the transition between a scorching dayside and a glacial nightside. Using a global climate model, we show that for water-limited planets it is possible to have scorching temperatures in the "eye" and freezing temperatures on the nightside, while maintaining a temperate climate in the terminator region, due to a reduced atmospheric energy transport. Whereas on water-rich planets, increasing stellar flux leads to increased atmospheric energy transport and a reduction in day-night temperature differences, such that the terminator does not remain habitable once the dayside temperatures approach runaway or moist greenhouse limits. We also show that, while water-abundant simulations may result in larger fractional habitability, they are vulnerable to water loss through cold-trapping on the nightside surface or atmospheric water vapor escape, suggesting that even if planets were formed with abundant water, their climates could become water-limited and subject to terminator habitability.},

We developed a model for the growth of a large planetesimal (embryo) embedded in a population of smaller planetesimals formed in a filament by the streaming instability. The model includes in a self-consistent way the collisional mass growth of the embryo, the fragmentation of the planetesimals, the velocity evolution of all involved bodies, as well as the viscous spreading of the filament. We find that the embryo accretes all available material in the filament during the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc only in the inner regions of the disc. In contrast, we find little or no growth in the outer parts of the disc beyond 5--10 AU. Overall, our results demonstrate very long timescales for collisional growth of planetesimals in the regions of the protoplanetary disc where giant planets form. As such, in order to form giant planets in cold orbits, pebble accretion must act directly on the largest bodies present in the initial mass-function of planetesimals with little or no help from mutual collisions.},

Such prolonged runaway greenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth. During this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is energy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost scales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux is proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing potential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may build up hundreds to thousands of bar of abiotically produced O2, resulting in potential false positives for life. The amount of O2 that builds up also scales with the planet mass; we find that O2 builds up at a constant rate that is controlled by diffusion: {$\sim$}5 bar/Myr on Earth-mass planets and up to {$\sim$}25 bar/Myr on super-Earths. As a result, some recently discovered super-Earths in the habitable zone such as GJ 667Cc could have built up as many as 2000 bar of O2 due to the loss of up to 10 Earth oceans of water. The fate of a given planet strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the surface. In general, we find that the initial phase of high luminosity may compromise the habitability of many terrestrial planets orbiting low-mass stars.

It is also critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches, which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a multi-planetary system transiting the M0 V dwarf HD 260655 (GJ 239, TOI-4599).

The planets were detected in transit by the TESS mission and confirmed independently with archival and new precise radial velocities obtained with the HIRES and CARMENES instruments since 1998 and 2016, respectively. At a distance of 10 pc, HD 260655 becomes the fourth closest known multi-transiting planet system after HD 219134, LTT 1445 A, and AU Mic. Due to the apparent brightness of the host star (J = 6.7 mag), both planets are among the most suitable rocky worlds known today for atmospheric studies with the JWST, both in transmission and emission.},

  abstract = {With the growing number of spectroscopic observations and observational platforms capable of exoplanet atmospheric characterization, there is a growing need for analysis techniques that can distill information about a large population of exoplanets into a coherent picture of atmospheric trends expressed within the statistical sample. In this work, we develop a Hierarchical Bayesian Atmospheric Retrieval (HBAR) model to infer population-level trends in exoplanet atmospheric characteristics. We demonstrate HBAR on the case of inferring a trend in atmospheric CO2 with incident stellar flux, predicted by the presence of a functioning carbonate-silicate weathering negative feedback cycle, an assumption upon which all calculations of the habitable zone (HZ) rest. Using simulated transmission spectra and JWST-quality observations of rocky planets with H2O, CO2, and N2 bearing atmospheres, we find that the predicted trend in CO2 causes subtle differences in the spectra of order 10 ppm in the 1-5 um range, underscoring the challenge inherent to testing this hypothesis. In the limit of highly precise data (100 stacked transits per planet), we show that our HBAR model is capable of inferring the population-level parameters that characterize the trend in CO2, and we demonstrate that the null hypothesis and other simpler trends can be rejected at high confidence. Although we find that this specific empirical test of the HZ may be prohibitively challenging in the JWST era, the HBAR framework developed in this work may find a more immediate usage for the analysis of gas giant spectra observed with JWST, Ariel, and other upcoming missions.}

With densities between those of rocky super-Earths and more extended mini-Neptunes, Hycean planets can be optimal candidates in the search for exoplanetary habitability and may be abundant in the exoplanet population. We investigate the bulk properties (masses, radii, and temperatures), potential for habitability, and observable biosignatures of Hycean planets. We show that Hycean planets can be significantly larger compared to previous considerations for habitable planets, with radii as large as 2.6 R {$\oplus$} (2.3 R {$\oplus$}) for a mass of 10 M {$\oplus$} (5 M {$\oplus$}). We construct the Hycean habitable zone (HZ), considering stellar hosts from late M to Sun-like stars, and find it to be significantly wider than the terrestrial-like HZ. While the inner boundary of the Hycean HZ corresponds to equilibrium temperatures as high as {$\sim$}500 K for late M dwarfs, the outer boundary is unrestricted to arbitrarily large orbital separations. Our investigations include tidally locked ``Dark Hycean'' worlds that permit habitable conditions only on their permanent nightsides and ``Cold Hycean'' worlds that see negligible irradiation. Finally, we investigate the observability of possible biosignatures in Hycean atmospheres. We find that a number of trace terrestrial biomarkers that may be expected to be present in Hycean atmospheres would be readily detectable using modest observing time with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We identify a sizable sample of nearby potential Hycean planets that can be ideal targets for such observations in search of exoplanetary biosignatures.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial exoplanets in habitable zones are ubiquitous. It is, however, unknown which have Earth-like or Venus-like climates. Distinguishing different planet-types is crucial for determining whether a planet could be habitable. We investigate the potential of polarimetry for distinguishing exo-Earths from exo-Venuses. We present computed fluxes and polarisation of starlight that is reflected by exoplanets with atmospheres in evolutionary states from current Earth to current Venus, with cloud compositions ranging from pure water to 0.75 sulfuric acid solution, for wavelengths between 0.3 and 2.5 microns. The polarisation of the reflected light shows larger variations with the planetary phase angle than the total flux. Across the visible, the largest polarisation is reached for an Earth-like atmosphere with water clouds, due to Rayleigh scattering above the clouds and the rainbow near 40 deg phase angle. In the near-infrared, the planet with a Venus-like CO2 atmosphere and thin water clouds shows the most prominent polarisation features due to scattering by the small cloud droplets. A planet around Alpha Centauri A would leave temporal variations on the order of 10E-13 W/m3 in the reflected flux and 10E-11 in the degree of polarisation along the planet's orbit for a spatially unresolved star-planet system. Star-planet contrasts are on the order of 10E-10. Current polarimeters cannot distinguish between the possible evolutionary phases of spatially unresolved terrestrial exoplanets, as a sensitivity near 10E-10 is required to discern the planet signal on the background of unpolarised starlight. Telescopes capable of reaching planet-star contrasts lower than 10E-9 should be able to observe the variation of the planet's resolved degree of polarisation as a function of its phase angle and thus to discern an exo-Earth from an exo-Venus based on its clouds' unique polarisation signatures.},

We are developing GMagAO-X to be available at or shortly after first-light of the GMT, to enable early high contrast exoplanet science in response to the Astro2020 recommendations. A key science goal is the characterization of nearby potentially habitable terrestrial worlds. GMagAO-Xis a woofer-tweeter system, with integrated segment phasing control. The tweeter is a 21,000 actuator segmented deformable mirror, composed of seven 3000 actuator segments. A multi-stage wavefront sensing system provides for bootstrapping, phasing, and high order sensing. The entire instrument is mounted in a rotator to provide gravity invariance. After the main AO system, visible (g to y) and near-IR (Y to H) science channels contain integrated coronagraphic wavefront control systems. The fully corrected and, optionally, coronagraphically filtered beams will then be fed to a suite of focal plane instrumentation including imagers and spectrographs. This will include existing facility instruments at GMT via fiber feeds. To assess the design we have developed an end-to-end frequency-domain modeling framework for assessing the performance of GMagAO-X. The dynamics of the many closed-loop feedback control systems are then modeled. Finally, we employ a frequency-domain model of post-processing algorithms to analyze the final post-processed sensitivity. The CoDR for GMagAO-X was held in September, 2021. Here we present an overview of the science cases, instrument design, expected performance, and concept of operations for GMagAO-X.},

However, the mechanism that creates the valley is unknown. The low mean densities of sub-Neptunes imply that they formed within a few million years and accreted primordial envelopes. Because these planets receive X-ray and UV fluxes comparable to the gravitational binding energy of their envelopes, their atmospheres are susceptible to mass loss. We model the thermal and compositional evolution of sub-Neptunes undergoing escape with diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium and show that preferential loss of hydrogen can change their atmospheric compositions. Planets with radii between 1.6 and 2.5\,R{$\oplus$} can obtain atmospheric helium mass fractions in excess of 40\% from billions of years of photoevaporation. Such enhancement can be detected through transmission spectroscopy, providing a novel observational test to determine whether atmospheric escape creates the radius valley.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. The ESA PLATO space mission is devoted to unveiling and characterizing new extrasolar planets and their host stars. This mission will encompass a very large ({$>$}2100 deg\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}) field of view, granting it the potential to survey up to one million stars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget of the spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar sample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to perform on-board data reduction is mandatory.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We employ mask-based (aperture) photometry to produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We considered three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and weighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a novel direct method. Each model was tested on synthetic images generated for 50 000 potential PLATO targets. We extracted the stellar population from the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 catalogue. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We determined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and frequency of threshold crossing events.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our results show that, although the binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious signals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects considerably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the former to deliver up to {$\sim$}30\% less false transit signatures at 7.1\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$} detection threshold.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be decisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum planet yield and substantially reduced occurrence of false positives for the PLATO mission. Overall, this work constitutes an important step in the design of both on-board and on-ground science data processing pipelines.}}}}}}}}},

To avoid any potential degeneracy in the parameter space, we imposed Bayesian priors on \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} and log\emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} based on the comprehensive, multi-band photometric data available for the sample. We find that this methodology is suitable down to M7.0 V, where refractory metals such as Ti are expected to condense in the stellar photospheres. The derived \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$}, log\emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$}, and [Fe/H] range from 3000 to 4200 K, 4.5 to 5.3 dex, and -0.7 to 0.2 dex, respectively. Although our \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} scale is in good agreement with the literature, we report large discrepancies in the [Fe/H] scales, which might arise from the different methodologies and sets of lines considered. However, our [Fe/H] is in agreement with the metallicity distribution of FGK-type stars in the solar neighbourhood and correlates well with the kinematic membership of the targets in the Galactic populations. Lastly, excellent agreement in \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} is found for M dwarfs with interferometric angular diameter measurements, as well as in the [Fe/H] between the components in the wide physical FGK+M and M+M systems included in our sample.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Previous analyses of Doppler and Kepler data have found that Sun-like stars hosting "cold Jupiters" (giant planets with \$a\textbackslash backslashgtrsim 1\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{AU\}\$) almost always host "inner super-Earths" (1-\$4\textbackslash backslash,R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, \$a\textbackslash backslashlesssim1\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{AU\}\$). Here, we attempt to determine the degree of alignment between the orbital planes of the cold Jupiters and the inner super-Earths. The key observational input is the fraction of Kepler stars with transiting super-Earths that also have transiting cold Jupiters. This fraction depends on both the probability for cold Jupiters to occur in such systems, and on the mutual orbital inclinations. Since the probability of occurrence has already been measured in Doppler surveys, we can use the data to constrain the dispersion of the mutual inclination distribution. We find \$\textbackslash backslashsigma=11.8\^\{+12.7\}\_\{-5.5\}\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (68\% confidence) and \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\textbackslash textgreater3.5\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (95\% confidence), where \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ is the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distribution. This suggests that planetary orbits in systems with cold Jupiters tend to be coplanar - although not quite as coplanar as those in the Solar System, which have a mean inclination from the invariable plane of \$1.8\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$. We also find evidence that cold Jupiters have lower mutual inclinations relative to inner systems with higher transit multiplicity. This suggests a link between the dynamical excitation in the inner and outer systems. For example, perturbations from misaligned cold Jupiters may dynamically heat or destabilize systems of inner super-Earths.},

In this paper, we numerically study the formation of planetary systems via pebble accretion and investigate the effects of disc properties such as masses, dissipation timescales, and metallicities on planet formation outcomes. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We improved the N-body code SyMBA that was modified for our Paper I by taking account of new planet-disc interaction models and type II migration. We adopted the `two-{$\alpha$}' disc model to mimic the effects of both the standard disc turbulence and the mass accretion driven by the magnetic disc wind. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We successfully reproduced the overall distribution trends of semi-major axes, eccentricities, and planetary masses of extrasolar giant planets. There are two types of giant planet formation trends, depending on whether or not the disc's dissipation timescales are comparable to the planet formation timescales. When planet formation happens fast enough, giant planets are fully grown (Jupiter mass or higher) and are distributed widely across the disc. On the other hand, when planet formation is limited by the disc's dissipation, discs generally form low-mass cold Jupiters. Our simulations also naturally explain why hot Jupiters (HJs) tend to be alone and how the observed eccentricity-metallicity trends arise. The low-metallicity discs tend to form nearly circular and coplanar HJs in situ, because planet formation is slower than high-metallicity discs, and thus protoplanetary cores migrate significantly before gas accretion. The high-metallicity discs, on the other hand, generate HJs in situ or via tidal circularisation of eccentric orbits. Both pathways usually involve dynamical instabilities, and thus HJs tend to have broader eccentricity and inclination distributions. When giant planets with very wide orbits ("super-cold Jupiters") are formed via pebble accretion followed by scattering, we predict that they belong to metal-rich stars, have eccentric orbits, and tend to have (\textasciitilde 80\%) companions interior to their orbits.},

We observed a substantial brightening of the debris disk at a wavelength of 3 to 5 micrometers, followed by a decay over a year, with quasi-periodic modulations of the disk flux. The behavior is consistent with the occurrence of a violent impact that produced vapor out of which a thick cloud of silicate spherules condensed that were then ground into dust by collisions.

The median mass of the stars in this sample is 0.17 M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$. We search the TESS 2-minute cadence light curves for transiting planets with orbital periods below 7 days using a modified Box-Least Squares (BLS) algorithm and recover all 6 known planets within the sample as well as a likely planet candidate orbiting LHS 475 (TESS Object of Interest 910.01). Each of these planets is consistent with a terrestrial composition, with planet radii ranging from 0.91 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ to 1.31 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$. In addition, we perform a transit injection and recovery analysis for each of the 363 stars to characterize the transit detection sensitivity as a function of planet radius, insolation, and orbital period. We obtain a cumulative occurrence rate of \$0.61\^\{+0.24\}\_\{-0.19\}\$ terrestrial planets per M dwarf with radii above 0.5 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ and orbital periods between 0.4-7 days. We find that for comparable insolations, planets larger than 1.5 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ (sub-Neptunes and water worlds) are significantly less abundant around mid-to-late M dwarfs compared to earlier-type stars, while the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets is comparable to that of more massive M dwarfs. We estimate that overall, terrestrials outnumber sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M dwarfs at a ratio of 14 to 1, in contrast to GK dwarfs where they are roughly equinumerous. We place a \$1\textbackslash sigma\$ upper limit of 0.07 planets larger than 1.5 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ per mid-to-late M dwarf, within the orbital period range of 0.5-7 days. We find evidence for a downturn in occurrence rates for planet radii below 0.9 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$, suggesting that Earth-sized and larger terrestrials may be more common around mid-to-late M dwarfs.},

The missions Juno to Jupiter and Cassini to Saturn have provided invaluable information to reveal their interiors like never before, including extremely accurate gravity data, atmospheric abundances and magnetic field measurements that revolutionised our knowledge of their interior structures. At the same time, new laboratory experiments and modelling efforts also improved, and statistical analysis of these planets is now possible to explore all the different conditions that shape their interiors.

The number of planets with optical phase curve detections, however, is currently too small to study them as an aggregate population, motivating an extension of the search to non-transiting planets. Here we present an algorithm for the detection of non-transiting, short-period giant planets in the Kepler field. The procedure uses the phase curves themselves as evidence for the planets' existence. We employ a supervised learning algorithm to recognize the salient time-dependent properties of synthetic phase curves; we then search for detections of signals that match these properties. After demonstrating the algorithm's capabilities, we classify 142,630 FGK Kepler stars without confirmed planets or KOIs and, for each one, assign a probability of a phase curve of a non-transiting planet being present. We identify 60 high-probability non-transiting hot Jupiter candidates. We also derive constraints on the candidates' albedos and offsets of the phase curve maxima. These targets are strong candidates for follow-up radial velocity confirmation and characterization. Once confirmed, the atmospheric information content in the phase curves may be studied in yet greater detail.},

By studying a uniform sample of Kepler "multis" with mass measurements from transit timing variations (TTVs), we show that a given planetary system tends to harbor a characteristic type of planet. That is, planets in a system have both masses and radii that are far more similar than if the system were assembled randomly from planets in the population. This finding has two important ramifications. First, the large intrinsic compositional scatter in the planet mass-radius relation is dominated by system-to-system variance rather than intra-system variance. Second, if provided enough properties of the star and primordial protoplanetary disk, there may be a substantial degree of predictability in the outcome of the planet formation process. We show that stellar mass and metallicity account for of order \$20\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the variation in outcomes; the remainder is as-yet unknown.},

Here we present evidence that the observed high-multiplicity Kepler systems truncate at smaller orbital periods than can be explained by geometric and detection biases alone. To show this, we considered the existence of hypothetical planets orbiting beyond the observed transiting planets with properties dictated by the "peas-in-a-pod" patterns of intra-system radius and period ratio uniformity. We evaluated the detectability of these hypothetical planets using (1) a novel approach for estimating the mutual inclination dispersion of multi-transiting systems based on transit chord length ratios and (2) a model of transit probability and detection efficiency that accounts for the impacts of planet multiplicity on completeness. Under the assumption that the "peas-in-a-pod" patterns continue to larger orbital separations than observed, we find that \$\textbackslash gtrsim35\textbackslash\%\$ of Kepler compact multis should possess additional detected planets beyond the known planets, constituting a \$\textbackslash sim7\textbackslash sigma\$ discrepancy with the lack of such detections. These results indicate that the outer (\$\textbackslash sim100-300\$ days) regions of compact multis experience a truncation (i.e. an "edge-of-the-multis") or a significant breakdown of the "peas-in-a-pod" patterns, in the form of systematically smaller radii or larger period ratios.

This framework allows us to characterise, quantify, and classify the architecture of an individual planetary system. Our aim in this endeavour is to generate a systematic method to study the arrangement and distribution of various planetary quantities within a single planetary system. We propose that the space of planetary system architectures be partitioned into four classes: similar, mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered. We applied our framework to observed and synthetic multi-planetary systems, thereby studying their architectures of mass, radius, density, core mass, and the core water mass fraction. We explored the relationships between a system's (mass) architecture and other properties. Our work suggests that: (a) similar architectures are the most common outcome of planet formation; (b) internal structure and composition of planets shows a strong link with their system architecture; (c) most systems inherit their mass architecture from their core mass architecture; (d) most planets that started inside the ice line and formed in-situ are found in systems with a similar architecture; and (e) most anti-ordered systems are expected to be rich in wet planets, while most observed mass ordered systems are expected to have many dry planets. We find, in good agreement with theory, that observations are generally biased towards the discovery of systems whose density architectures are similar, mixed, or anti-ordered. This study probes novel questions and new parameter spaces for understanding theory and observations. Future studies may utilise our framework to not only constrain the knowledge of individual planets, but also the multi-faceted architecture of an entire planetary system. We also speculate on the role of system architectures in hosting habitable worlds.},

  abstract = {In the first paper of this series, we proposed a model-independent framework for characterising the architecture of planetary systems at the system level. There are four classes of planetary system architecture: similar, mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered. In this paper, we investigate the formation pathways leading to these four architecture classes. To understand the role of nature versus nurture in sculpting the final (mass) architecture of a system, we apply our architecture framework to synthetic planetary systems -- formed via core-accretion -- using the Bern model. General patterns emerge in the formation pathways of the four architecture classes. Almost all planetary systems emerging from protoplanetary disks whose initial solid mass was less than one Jupiter mass are similar. Systems emerging from heavier disks may become mixed, anti-ordered, or ordered. Increasing dynamical interactions (planet-planet, planet-disk) tends to shift a system's architecture from mixed to anti-ordered to ordered. Our model predicts the existence of a new metallicity-architecture correlation. Similar systems have very high occurrence around low-metallicity stars. The occurrence of the anti-ordered and ordered classes increases with increasing metallicity. The occurrence of mixed architecture first increases and then decreases with increasing metallicity. In our synthetic planetary systems, the role of nature is disentangled from the role of nurture. Nature (or initial conditions) pre-determines whether the architecture of a system becomes similar; otherwise nurture influences whether a system becomes mixed, anti-ordered, or ordered. We propose the `Aryabhata formation scenario' to explain some planetary systems which host only water-rich worlds. We finish this paper with a discussion of future observational and theoretical works that may support or refute the results of this paper.},

  abstract = {Close binaries suppress the formation of circumstellar (S-type) planets and therefore significantly bias the inferred planet occurrence rates and statistical trends. After compiling various radial velocity and high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a {$<$} 1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close planets at 15\$\_\{-12\}\^\{+17\}\$ per cent the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries with a {$>$} 200 au have a negligible effect on close planet formation. We show that F = 43 {$\pm$} 7 per cent of solar-type primaries in magnitude-limited samples do not host close planets due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter and close Neptune occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. Additionally, about half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets towards low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction.},

  abstract = {Constraining planet formation based on the atmospheric composition of exoplanets is a fundamental goal of the exoplanet community. Existing studies commonly try to constrain atmospheric abundances, or to analyze what abundance patterns a given description of planet formation predicts. However, there is also a pressing need to develop methodologies that investigate how to transform atmospheric compositions into planetary formation inferences. In this study we summarize the complexities and uncertainties of state-of-the-art planet formation models and how they influence planetary atmospheric compositions. We introduce a methodology that explores the effect of different formation model assumptions when interpreting atmospheric compositions. We apply this framework to the directly imaged planet HR 8799e. Based on its atmospheric composition, this planet may have migrated significantly during its formation. We show that including the chemical evolution of the protoplanetary disk leads to a reduced need for migration. Moreover, we find that pebble accretion can reproduce the planet's composition, but some of our tested setups lead to too low atmospheric metallicities, even when considering that evaporating pebbles may enrich the disk gas. We conclude that the definitive inversion from atmospheric abundances to planet formation for a given planet may be challenging, but a qualitative understanding of the effects of different formation models is possible, opening up pathways for new investigations.},

Given that the giant planets formed first in the protoplanetary disk, we stress the sensitive dependence of the terrestrial planet accretion process on the orbital architecture of the giant planets and on their evolution. This suggests a great diversity among the terrestrial planet populations in extrasolar systems.

These low-mass planets are highly irradiated and the question of their origin, evolution, and possible links remains open. Here we show that close-in ocean planets affected by the greenhouse effect display hydrospheres in supercritical state, which generate inflated atmospheres without invoking the presence of large hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes. We present a new set of mass\textendash radius relationships for ocean planets with different compositions and different equilibrium temperatures, which are found to be well adapted to low-density sub-Neptune planets. Our model suggests that super-Earths and water-rich sub-Neptunes could belong to the same family of planets, i.e., hydrogen/helium-free planets, with differences between their interiors simply resulting from the variation in the water content.},

  abstract = {The Kepler spacecraft has discovered a large number of planets with up to one-year periods and down to terrestrial sizes. While the majority of the target stars are main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with effective temperatures as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These cooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone, yet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK stars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of different spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the star and show that they are significantly different from each other. We further identify two trends. First, the occurrence of Earth- to Neptune-sized planets (1\textendash 4 R{$\oplus$}) is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital periods probed by Kepler; planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as around G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in planet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a {$\sim$}10 day orbital period, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median stellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is stellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of stellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping, and destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the pre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of migrating planets or planetary building blocks close to the star. These results demonstrate the stellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence rate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the inner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration of planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters.},

  abstract = {The water-ice or snow line is one of the key properties of protoplanetary disks that determines the water content of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone. Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass accretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in the disk. We calculate the snow-line location from recent observations of mass accretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial disk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow-line locations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow-line locations of {$\sim$}0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the 1{$\sigma$} snow-line location among solar-mass stars of the same age ranges from {$\sim$}2 to {$\sim$}5 AU. For more realistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located up to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of N-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial planets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion in snow-line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like dust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around Sun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of low-mass M stars ( 0.5 \{M\}{$\odot$} ) as in previous works. The closer-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the habitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars. Considering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host most of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are able to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution.},

Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42\% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au could be as high as 100\% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars of eta\_earth=36+-14\%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than {$\sim$}8\% and {$\sim$}3\% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.},

We use a pebble drift and accretion model to simulate the growth of planet cores inside and outside of the snow line. A smaller pebble size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 M {$\odot$} and for a range of initial disk masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets are anticorrelated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial-velocity surveys. A key testable prediction of the pebble accretion hypothesis is that the occurrence rates of super-Earths should decrease again for M dwarfs near the substellar boundary like Trappist-1.},

However, dust mass measurements of Class II disks with ALMA have called into question whether they contain enough solids to build the exoplanets that have been detected to date. In this paper, we calculate the mass and spatial scale of solid material around Sun-like stars probed by transit and radial velocity exoplanet surveys, and compare those to the observed dust masses and sizes of Class II disks in the same stellar mass regime. We show that the apparent mass discrepancy disappears when accounting for observational selection and detection biases. We find a discrepancy only when the planet formation efficiency is below 100\%, or if there is a population of undetected exoplanets that significantly contributes to the mass in solids. We identify a positive correlation between the masses of planetary systems and their respective orbital periods, which is consistent with the trend between the masses and the outer radii of Class II dust disks. This implies that, despite a factor 100 difference in spatial scale, the properties of protoplanetary disks seem to be imprinted on the exoplanet population.}

We explore two simple toy models\textemdash in the first the radii of the planets are chosen at random from a single universal distribution, and in the second we postulate several types of system with distinct radius distributions. We show that an apparent correlation between the radii of adjacent planets similar to the one reported by Weiss et al. (2018) can arise in both models. In addition the second model fits all other aspects of the radius distribution, including the signal-to-noise distribution of the observed planets. We also comment on the validity of a commonly used correction that is used to estimate intrinsic planet occurrence rates, based on weighting planets by the inverse of their detectability.},

  abstract = {SPECULOOS-South, an observatory composed of four independent 1-m robotic telescopes, located at ESO Paranal, Chile, started scientific operation in 2019 January. This Southern hemisphere facility operates as part of the Search for Habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars (SPECULOOS), an international network of 1-m-class telescopes surveying for transiting terrestrial planets around the nearest and brightest ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). To automatically and efficiently process the observations of SPECULOOS-South, and to deal with the specialized photometric requirements of UCD targets, we present our automatic pipeline. This pipeline includes an algorithm for automated differential photometry and an extensive correction technique for the effects of telluric water vapour, using ground measurements of the precipitable water vapour. Observing very red targets in the near-infrared can result in photometric systematics in the differential light curves, related to the temporally-varying, wavelength-dependent opacity of the Earth's atmosphere. These systematics are sufficient to affect the daily quality of the light curves, the longer time-scale variability study of our targets and even mimic transit-like signals. Here we present the implementation and impact of our water vapour correction method. Using the 179 nights and 98 targets observed in the I + z{${'}$} filter by SPECULOOS-South since 2019 January, we show the impressive photometric performance of the facility (with a median precision of {$\sim$}1.5\,mmag for 30-min binning of the raw, non-detrended light curves) and assess its detection potential. We compare simultaneous observations with SPECULOOS-South and TESS, to show that we readily achieve high-precision, space-level photometry for bright, UCDs, highlighting SPECULOOS-South as the first facility of its kind.},

  abstract = {The similar orbital distances and detection rates of debris disks and the prominent rings observed in protoplanetary disks suggest a potential connection between these structures. We explore this connection with new calculations that follow the evolution of rings of pebbles and planetesimals as they grow into planets and generate dusty debris. Depending on the initial solid mass and planetesimal formation efficiency, the calculations predict diverse outcomes for the resulting planet masses and accompanying debris signature. When compared with debris disk incidence rates as a function of luminosity and time, the model results indicate that the known population of bright cold debris disks can be explained by rings of solids with the (high) initial masses inferred for protoplanetary disk rings and modest planetesimal formation efficiencies that are consistent with current theories of planetesimal formation. These results support the possibility that large protoplanetary disk rings evolve into the known cold debris disks. The inferred strong evolutionary connection between protoplanetary disks with large rings and mature stars with cold debris disks implies that the remaining majority population of low-mass stars with compact protoplanetary disks leaves behind only modest masses of residual solids at large radii and evolves primarily into mature stars without detectable debris beyond 30 au. The approach outlined here illustrates how combining observations with detailed evolutionary models of solids strongly constrains the global evolution of disk solids and underlying physical parameters such as the efficiency of planetesimal formation and the possible existence of invisible reservoirs of solids in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {Abstract A simple one-dimensional radiative\textendash convective equilibrium model is used to investigate the relationship between the surface temperature and the outgoing infrared radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The model atmosphere has a gray infrared absorption coefficient and is composed of a radiative equilibrium stratosphere and a moist adiabat troposphere. An upper limit of the outgoing infrared radiation is found to exist. The existence of the upper limit is characterized by the radiation limits that appear when the optical depth of the entire atmosphere becomes sufficiently deep and the temperature structure around the levels where the optical depth is about unity approaches a fixed profile. This appearance of an upper limit differs from that found by Komabayashi and Ingersoll, which is obtained from the constraint of the stratospheric radiation balance. As one of those radiation limits, the outgoing infrared radiation has an asymptotic limit as the surface temperature increases. This is caused by the tropospheric structure approaching the water vapor saturation curve. It is considered that the asymptotic limits appearing in the radiatively and thermodynamically more complicated models utilized by Abe and Matsui and Kasting are corresponding to this asymptotic limit indicated in our model.},

  abstract = {Correlations between the occurrence rate of exoplanets and their host star properties provide important clues about the planet formation process. We studied the dependence of the observed properties of exoplanets (radius, mass, and orbital period) as a function of their host star metallicity. We analyzed the planetary radii and orbital periods of over 2800 Kepler candidates from the latest Kepler data release, DR25 (Q1\textendash Q17), with revised planetary radii based on Gaia DR2 as a function of host star metallicity (from the Q1\textendash Q17 (DR25) stellar and planet catalog). With a much larger sample and improved radius measurements, we are able to reconfirm previous results in the literature. We show that the average metallicity of the host star increases as the radius of the planet increases. We demonstrate this by first calculating the average host star metallicity for different radius bins and then supplementing these results by calculating the occurrence rate as a function of planetary radius and host star metallicity. We find a similar trend between host star metallicity and planet mass: the average host star metallicity increases with increasing planet mass. This trend, however, reverses for masses {$>$}4.0 MJ: host star metallicity drops with increasing planetary mass. We further examined the correlation between the host star metallicity and the orbital period of the planet. We find that for planets with orbital periods less than 10 days, the average metallicity of the host star is higher than that for planets with periods greater than 10 days.},

The choice of the fields to be pointed at is a crucial task since it has a direct impact on the scientific return of the mission. In this paper, we describe and discuss the formal requirements and the key scientific prioritization criteria that have to be taken into account in the Long-duration Observation Phase (LOP) field selection, and apply a quantitative metric to guide us in this complex optimization process. We identify two provisional LOP fields, one for each hemisphere (LOPS1 and LOPN1), and we discuss their properties and stellar content. While additional fine-tuning shall be applied to LOP selection before the definitive choice, which is set to be made two years before launch, we expect that their position will not move by more than a few degrees with respect to what is proposed in this paper.},

We explore water worlds within the framework of a joint mass-radius-period distribution of planets fit to a sample of transiting Kepler exoplanets, a subset of which have radial velocity mass measurements. We employ hierarchical Bayesian modeling to create a range of ten mixture models that include multiple compositional subpopulations of exoplanets. We model these subpopulations - including planets with gaseous envelopes, evaporated rocky cores, evaporated icy cores, intrinsically rocky planets, and intrinsically icy planets - in different combinations in order to assess which combinations are most favored by the data. Using cross-validation, we evaluate the support for models that include planets with icy compositions compared to the support for models that do not, finding broad support for both. We find significant population-level degeneracies between subpopulations of water worlds and planets with primordial envelopes. Among models that include one or more icy-core subpopulations, we find a wide range for the fraction of planets with icy compositions, with a rough upper limit of 50\%. Improved datasets or alternative modeling approaches may better be able to distinguish between these subpopulations of planets.},

This effect is particularly of concern for M dwarfs, which can remain magnetically active for billions of years. We compile rotation periods for late-type stars and for the M dwarf planet-host sample in order to investigate the rotation periods of older field stars across the main sequence. We show that for stars with masses between 0.25 and 0.5 (M4V\textendash M1V), the stellar rotation period typical of field stars coincides with the orbital periods of planets in the habitable zone. This will pose a fundamental challenge to the discovery and characterization of potentially habitable planets around early M dwarfs. Due to the longer rotation periods reached by mid M dwarfs and the shorter orbital period at which the planetary habitable zone is found, stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.25 (M6V\textendash M4V) offer better opportunities for the detection of habitable planets via radial velocities.},

TOI 451 is a member of the 120 Myr old Pisces\textendash Eridanus stream (Psc\textendash Eri). We confirm membership in the stream with its kinematics, its lithium abundance, and the rotation and UV excesses of both TOI 451 and its wide-binary companion, TOI 451 B (itself likely an M-dwarf binary). We identified three candidate planets transiting in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data and followed up the signals with photometry from Spitzer and ground-based telescopes. The system comprises three validated planets at periods of 1.9, 9.2, and 16 days, with radii of 1.9, 3.1, and 4.1 R{$\bigotimes$}, respectively. The host star is near-solar mass with V = 11.0 and H = 9.3 and displays an infrared excess indicative of a debris disk. The planets offer excellent prospects for transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, providing the opportunity to study planetary atmospheres that may still be in the process of evolving.},

Even more challenging for the novice peer reviewer is that journals also vary widely in their review guidelines. Nonetheless, the goals of peer review are crystal clear: to ensure the accuracy and improve the quality of published literature through constructive criticism. To make the peer review process as efficient and productive as possible, you may want to consider a few useful approaches to tackling major steps throughout your review, from contemplating a review request and reading and assessing the manuscript to writing the review and interacting with the journal's editors (see Figure 1).

However, lack of knowledge on the state of matter in  H 2 H2 O-rich setting at high pressures and temperatures ( {$\mathsl{P}-\mathsl{T}$} P-T ) places important limitations on our understanding of this planet type. We have conducted experiments for reactions between  SiO 2 SiO2  and  H 2 H2 O as archetypal materials for rock and ice, respectively, at high  {$\mathsl{P}-\mathsl{T}$} P-T . We found anomalously expanded volumes of dense silica (up to 4\%) recovered from hydrothermal synthesis above  {$\sim$} {$\sim$} 24 GPa where the  CaCl 2 CaCl2 -type (Ct) structure appears at lower pressures than in the anhydrous system. Infrared spectroscopy identified strong OH modes from the dense silica samples. Both previous experiments and our density functional theory calculations support up to 0.48 hydrogen atoms per formula unit of ( Si 1-{$\mathsl{x}$} H 4{$\mathsl{x}$} Si1-xH4x ) O 2 ({$\mathsl{x}$}=0.12) O2\,(x=0.12) . At pressures above 60 GPa,  H 2 H2 O further changes the structural behavior of silica, stabilizing a niccolite-type structure, which is unquenchable. From unit-cell volume and phase equilibrium considerations, we infer that the niccolite-type phase may contain H with an amount at least comparable with or higher than that of the Ct phase. Our results suggest that the phases containing both hydrogen and lithophile elements could be the dominant materials in the interiors of water-rich planets. Even for fully layered cases, the large mutual solubility could make the boundary between rock and ice layers fuzzy. Therefore, the physical properties of the new phases that we report here would be important for understanding dynamics, geochemical cycle, and dynamo generation in water-rich planets.},

Observational advances over the last decade have enabled high-resolution, interferometric studies of forming multiple systems, statistical surveys of multiplicity in star-forming regions, and new insights into disk evolution and planetary architectures in these systems. In this review, we compile the results of observational and theoretical studies of stellar multiplicity. We summarize the population statistics spanning system evolution from the protostellar phase through the main-sequence phase and evaluate the influence of the local environment.

  abstract = {Understanding the physical characteristics of Venus, including its atmosphere, interior, and its evolutionary pathway with respect to Earth, remains a vital component for terrestrial planet evolution models and the emergence and/or decline of planetary habitability. A statistical strategy for evaluating the evolutionary pathways of terrestrial planets lies in the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets, where the sample size provides sufficient means for determining required runaway greenhouse conditions. Observations of potential exoVenuses can help confirm hypotheses about Venus' past, as well as the occurrence rate of Venus-like planets in other systems. Additionally, the data from future Venus missions, such as DAVINCI, EnVision, and VERITAS, will provide valuable information regarding Venus, and the study of exoVenuses will be complimentary to these missions. To facilitate studies of exoVenus candidates, we provide a catalog of all confirmed terrestrial planets in the Venus Zone, including transiting and non-transiting cases, and quantify their potential for follow-up observations. We examine the demographics of the exoVenus population with relation to stellar and planetary properties, such as the planetary radius gap. We highlight specific high-priority exoVenus targets for follow-up observations including: TOI-2285 b, LTT 1445 A c, TOI-1266 c, LHS 1140 c, and L98-59 d. We also discuss follow-up observations that may yield further insight into the Venus/Earth divergence in atmospheric properties.},

Studying the different populations of exoplanets is important for understanding the demographics of the different planetary types, which can then be linked to planetary formation and evolution.

The resulting mass-radius (M-R) diagram shows two distinct populations, corresponding to rocky and volatile-rich exoplanets which overlap in both mass and radius. The rocky exoplanet population shows a relatively small density variability and ends at mass of \textasciitilde 25 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, possibly indicating the maximum core mass that can be formed. We use the composition line of pure water to separate the two populations, and infer two new empirical M-R relations based on this data: \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$} = (0.9 {$\pm$} 0.06) \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{(3.45{$\pm$}0.12){$<$}sup/{$>$} for the rocky population, and \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$} = (1.74 {$\pm$} 0.38) \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{(1.58{$\pm$}0.10){$<$}sup/{$>$} for the volatile-rich population.

For planets with radii {$\sim$}1\textendash 6 R{$\oplus$} and periods {$<$}100 days, we find that, except for a normalization factor, the occurrence rate versus q can be described by the same broken power law with a break at {$\sim$}3 \texttimes{} 10-5 independent of host type for hosts below 1 M{$\odot$}. These findings indicate that the planet-to-star mass ratio is a more fundamental quantity in planet formation than planet mass. We then compare our results to those from microlensing for which the overwhelming majority satisfies the Mhost {$<$} 1 M{$\odot$} criterion. The break in q for the microlensing planet population, which mostly probes the region outside the snowline, is {$\sim$}3\textendash 10 times higher than that inferred from Kepler. Thus, the most common planet inside the snowline is {$\sim$}3\textendash 10 times less massive than the one outside. With rocky planets interior to gaseous planets, the solar system broadly follows the combined mass-ratio function inferred from Kepler and microlensing. However, the exoplanet population has a less extreme radial distribution of planetary masses than the solar system. Establishing whether the mass-ratio function beyond the snowline is also host type independent will be crucial to build a comprehensive theory of planet formation.},

The correction was evaluated on global light curves of nearby late M- and L-type stars observed by SPECULOOS' Southern Observatory (SSO) with the I~+~z{${'}$} bandpass, using PWV measurements from the LHATPRO and local temperature/humidity sensors. A median reduction in RMS of 1.1~per\,cent was observed for variability shorter than the expected transit duration for SSO's targets.

  abstract = {The Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is the next NASA astrophysics flagship mission, to follow the James Webb Space Telescope. The WFIRST mission was chosen as the top-priority large space mission of the 2010 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey in order to achieve three primary goals: to study dark energy via a wide-field imaging survey, to study exoplanets via a microlensing survey, and to enable a guest observer program. Here we assess the ability of the several WFIRST designs to achieve the goal of the microlensing survey to discover a large sample of cold, low-mass exoplanets with semimajor axes beyond roughly one astronomical unit, which are largely impossible to detect with any other technique. We present the results of a suite of simulations that span the full range of the proposed WFIRST architectures, from the original design envisioned by the decadal survey, to the current design, which utilizes a 2.4 m telescope donated to NASA. By studying such a broad range of architectures, we are able to determine the impact of design trades on the expected yields of detected exoplanets. In estimating the yields we take particular care to ensure that our assumed Galactic model predicts microlensing event rates that match observations, consider the impact that inaccuracies in the Galactic model might have on the yields, and ensure that numerical errors in light-curve computations do not bias the yields for the smallest-mass exoplanets. For the nominal baseline WFIRST design and a fiducial planet mass function, we predict that a total of {$\sim$}1400 bound exoplanets with mass greater than {$\sim$}0.1 M {$\oplus$} should be detected, including {$\sim$}200 with mass {$\lessequivlnt$}3 M {$\oplus$}. WFIRST should have sensitivity to planets with mass down to {$\sim$}0.02 M {$\oplus$}, or roughly the mass of Ganymede.},

  abstract = {Planets and their host stars carry a long-term memory of their origin in their chemical compositions. Thus, identifying planets formed in different environments improves our understating of planetary formation. Although restricted to detecting exoplanets within the solar vicinity, we might be able to detect planetary systems that formed in small external galaxies and later merged with the Milky Way. In fact, Gaia data have unequivocally shown that the Galaxy underwent several significant minor mergers during its first billion years of formation. The stellar debris of one of these mergers, Gaia-Enceladus (GE), is thought to have built up most of the stellar halo in the solar neighborhood. In this Letter, we investigate the origin of known planet-host stars combining data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with Gaia EDR3 and large-scale spectroscopic surveys. We adopt a kinematic criterion and identify 42 stars associated with the Milky Way's thick disk and one halo star. The only halo star identified, BD+20 2457, known to harbor two exoplanets, moves on a retrograde and highly eccentric orbit. Its chemical abundance pattern situates the star at the border between the thick disk, the old halo, and accreted populations. Given its orbital parameters and chemical properties, we suggest that BD+20 2457 is likely formed in the protodisk of the Galaxy, but we do not exclude the possibility of the star belonging to the debris of GE. Finally, we estimate a minimum age and mass limit for the star, which has implications for its planetary system and will be tested with future Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observations.},

Our assessment is based on a large representative sample of host stars from the TRILEGAL Galaxy population synthesis model, recent estimates of the exoplanet frequency distributions as a function of stellar type, and detailed simulation of the Gaia observations using the updated instrument performance and scanning law. We use two approaches to estimate detectable planetary systems: one based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the astrometric signature per field crossing, easily reproducible and allowing comparisons with previous estimates, and a new and more robust metric based on orbit fitting to the simulated satellite data. With some plausible assumptions on planet occurrences, we find that some 21,000 ({$\pm$}6000) high-mass ({$\sim$}1\textendash 15MJ) long-period planets should be discovered out to distances of {$\sim$}500 pc for the nominal 5 yr mission (including at least 1000\textendash 1500 around M dwarfs out to 100 pc), rising to some 70,000 ({$\pm$}20, 000) for a 10 yr mission.

  abstract = {Highly irradiated planets in the hot Neptune desert are usually either small (R {$<$} 2 Rearth) and rocky or they are gas giants with radii of {$>$}1 Rjup. Here, we report on the intermediate-sized planet TOI-2196 on a 1.2 day orbit around a G-type star discovered by TESS in sector 27. We collected 42 radial velocity measurements with the HARPS spectrograph to determine the mass. The radius of TOI-2196 b is 3.51 +/- 0.15 Rearth, which, combined with the mass of 26.0 +/- 1.3 Mearth, results in a bulk density of 3.31+0.51-0.43 g/cm3. Hence, the radius implies that this planet is a sub-Neptune, although the density is twice than that of Neptune. A significant trend in the HARPS radial velocities points to the presence of a distant companion with a lower limit on the period and mass of 220 days and 0.65 Mjup, respectively, assuming zero eccentricity. The short period of planet b implies a high equilibrium temperature of 1860 +/- 20 K, for zero albedo and isotropic emission. This places the planet in the hot Neptune desert, joining a group of very few planets in this parameter space discovered in recent years. These planets suggest that the hot Neptune desert may be divided in two parts for planets with equilibrium temperatures of {$>$} 1800 K: a hot sub-Neptune desert devoid of planets with radii of 1.8-3 Rearth and a sub-Jovian desert for radii of 5-12 Rearth. More planets in this parameter space are needed to further investigate this finding. Planetary interior structure models of TOI-2196 b are consistent with a H/He atmosphere mass fraction between 0.4 \% and 3 \%, with a mean value of 0.7 \% on top of a rocky interior. We estimated the amount of mass this planet might have lost at a young age, and we find that while the mass loss could have been significant, the planet had not changed in terms of character: it was born as a small volatile-rich planet, and it remains one at present.},

Studies are therefore dependent on subgrid models to emulate the micro physics of dust coagulation on top of a large scale hydrodynamic simulation. Numerical simulations which include the relevant physical effects are complex and computationally expensive. Here, we present a fast and accurate learned effective model for dust coagulation, trained on data from high resolution numerical coagulation simulations. Our model captures details of the dust coagulation process that were so far not tractable with other dust coagulation prescriptions with similar computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {We explore the prospects for Twinkle to determine the atmospheric composition of the nearby terrestrial-like planet LTT 1445 Ab, including the possibility of detecting the potential biosignature ammonia (NH\$\_\{3\}\$). At a distance of 6.9 pc, this system is the second closest known transiting system and will be observed through transmission spectroscopy with the upcoming Twinkle mission. Twinkle is equipped with a 0.45 m telescope, covers a spectral wavelength range of 0.5 - 4.5 \$\textbackslash mu\$m simultaneously with a resolving power between 50 - 70, and is designed to study exoplanets, bright stars, and solar system objects. We investigate the mission's potential to study LTT 1445 Ab and find that Twinkle data can distinguish between a cold Haber World (N\$\_2\$-H\$\_2\$-dominated atmosphere) and a Hycean World with a H\$\_2\$O-H\$\_2\$-dominated atmosphere, with a \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash nu\}\^\{2\}\$ = 3.01. Interior composition analysis favors a Haber World scenario for LTT 1445 Ab, which suggests that the planet probably lacks a substantial water layer. We use petitRADTRANS and a Twinkle simulator to simulate transmission spectra for the more likely scenario of a cold Haber World for which NH\$\_\{3\}\$ is considered to be a biosignature. We study the detectability under different scenarios: varying hydrogen fraction, concentration of ammonia, and cloud coverage. We find that ammonia can be detected at a \$\textbackslash sim\$ 3\$\textbackslash sigma\$ level for optimal (non-cloudy) conditions with 25 transits and a volume mixing ration of 4.0 ppm of NH\$\_\{3\}\$. We provide examples of retrieval analysis to constrain potential NH\$\_\{3\}\$ and H\$\_\{2\}\$O in the atmosphere. Our study illustrates the potential of Twinkle to characterize atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.},

  abstract = {The population of planets smaller than approximately 1.7\,Earth radii (R{$\oplus$}) is widely interpreted as consisting of rocky worlds, generally referred to as super-Earths. This picture is largely corroborated by radial velocity mass measurements for close-in super-Earths but lacks constraints at lower insolations. Here we present the results of a detailed study of the Kepler-138 system using 13 Hubble and Spitzer transit observations of the warm-temperate 1.51\,{$\pm$}\,0.04\,R{$\oplus$} planet Kepler-138 d (\$\$\{T\}\_\{\textbackslash rm\{eq,A\_\{\textbackslash rm\{B\}\} = 0.3\}\}\textbackslash approx 350\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash mathrm\{K\}\}\$\$) combined with new radial velocity measurements of its host star obtained with the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We find evidence for a volatile-rich `water world' nature of Kepler-138 d, with a large fraction of its mass \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm\{d\}\}\$ contained in a thick volatile layer. This finding is independently supported by transit timing variations and radial velocity observations (\$\$\{M\}\_\{\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{d\}\}\}\}\}=2.\{1\}\_\{-0.7\}\^\{+0.6\}\textbackslash,\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash oplus \}\$\$), as well as the flat optical/infrared transmission spectrum. Quantitatively, we infer a composition of \$\$1\{1\}\_\{-4\}\^\{+3\}\textbackslash\%\$\$volatiles by mass or \textasciitilde 51\% by volume, with a 2,000-km-deep water mantle and atmosphere on top of a core with an Earth-like silicates/iron ratio. Any hypothetical hydrogen layer consistent with the observations ({$<$}0.003\,M{$\oplus$}) would have swiftly been lost on a \textasciitilde 10\,Myr timescale. The bulk composition of Kepler-138 d therefore resembles those of the icy moons, rather than the terrestrial planets, in the Solar System. We conclude that not all super-Earths are rocky worlds, but that volatile-rich water worlds exist in an overlapping size regime, especially at lower insolations. Finally, our photodynamical analysis also reveals that Kepler-138 c (with a Rc\,=\,1.51\,{$\pm$}\,0.04\,R{$\oplus$} and a \$\$\{M\}\_\{\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{c\}\}\}\}\}=2.\{3\}\_\{-0.5\}\^\{+0.6\}\textbackslash,\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash oplus \}\$\$) is a slightly warmer twin of Kepler-138 d (that is, another water world in the same system) and we infer the presence of Kepler-138 e, a likely non-transiting planet at the inner edge of the habitable zone.},

  abstract = {The implications of the water vapor runaway greenhouse phenomenon for water-rich subNeptunes are developed. In particular, the nature of the post-runaway equilibration process for planets that have an extremely high water inventory is addressed. Crossing the threshold from sub-runaway to super-runaway conditions leads to a transition from equilibrated states with cold deep liquid oceans and deep interior ice-X phases to states with hot supercritical fluid interiors. There is a corresponding marked inflation of radius for a given mass, similar to the runaway greenhouse radius inflation effect noted earlier for terrestrial planets, but in the present case the inflation involves the entire interior of the planet. The calculation employs the AQUA equation of state database to simplify the internal structure calculation. Some speculations concerning the effect of \$\textbackslash mathrm\{H\_2\}\$ admixture, silicate cores and hot vs. cold start evolution trajectories are offered. Observational implications are discussed, though the search for the mass-radius signature of the phenomena considered is limited by degeneracies and by lack of data.},

Observations of protoplanetary disks around very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs remain challenging and little is known about their properties. The disk around CIDA 1 (\textasciitilde 0.1\textendash 0.2 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) is one of the very few known disks that host a large cavity (20 au radius in size) around a very low-mass star. We present new ALMA observations at Band 7 (0.9 mm) and Band 4 (2.1 mm) of CIDA 1 with a resolution of \textasciitilde 0.05{${''}$} \texttimes{} 0.034{${''}$}. These new ALMA observations reveal a very bright and unresolved inner disk, a shallow spectral index of the dust emission (\textasciitilde 2), and a complex morphology of a ring located at 20 au. We also present X-shooter (VLT) observations that confirm the high accretion rate of CIDA 1 of \emph{\.M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{acc{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 1.4 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-8{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. This high value of \emph{\.M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{acc{$<$}sub/{$>$}, the observed inner disk, and the large cavity of 20 au exclude models of photo-evaporation to explain the observed cavity. When comparing these observations with models that combine planet\textendash disk interaction, dust evolution, and radiative transfer, we exclude planets more massive than 0.5 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Jup{$<$}sub/{$>$} as the potential origin of the large cavity because with these it is difficult to maintain a long-lived and bright inner disk. Even in this planet mass regime, an additional physical process may be needed to stop the particles from migrating inwards and to maintain a bright inner disk on timescales of millions of years. Such mechanisms include a trap formed by a very close-in extra planet or the inner edge of a dead zone. The low spectral index of the disk around CIDA 1 is difficult to explain and challenges our current dust evolution models, in particular processes like fragmentation, growth, and diffusion of particles inside pressure bumps.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

In addition, the dust radial drift of particles is expected to be a more difficult barrier to overcome during the first steps of planet formation in these disks. ALMA high-angular resolution observations of few protoplanetary disks around BDs and VLMS have shown substructures as in the disks around Sun-like stars. Such observations suggest that giant planets embedded in the disks are the most likely origin of the observed substructures. However, this type of planets represent less than 2\% of the confirmed exoplanets so far around all stars, and they are difficult to form by different core accretion models (either pebble or planetesimal accretion). Dedicated deep observations of disks around BDs and VLMS with ALMA and JWST will provide significant progress on understanding the main properties of these objects (e.g., disk size and mass), which is crucial for determining the physical mechanisms that rule the evolution of these disks and the effect on the potential planets that may form in these environments.},

From that moment, the mantle convective thermal flux control the cooling of the planet and an atmosphere is created by outgassing. This atmosphere will then play a key role during this cooling phase. Studying this cooling phase in details is a necessary step to explain the great diversity of the observed telluric planets and especially to assess the presence of surface liquid water. We used here a radiative-convective 1D atmospheric model (H2O, CO2) to study the impact of the Bond albedo on the evolution of magma ocean planets. We derived from this model the thermal emission spectrum and the spectral reflectance of these planets, from which we calculated their Bond albedos. Compared to Marcq et~al. (2017), the model now includes a new module to compute the Rayleigh scattering, and state of the art CO2 and H2O gaseous opacities data in the visible and infrared spectral ranges. We show that the Bond albedo of these planets depends on their surface temperature and results from a competition between Rayleigh scattering from the gases and Mie scattering from the clouds. The colder the surface temperature is, the thicker the clouds are, and the higher the Bond albedo is. We also evidence that the relative abundances of CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere strongly impact the Bond albedo. The Bond albedo is higher for atmospheres dominated by the CO2, better Rayleigh scatterer than H2O. Finally, we provide the community with an empirical formula for the Bond albedo that could be useful for future studies of magma ocean planets.},

Whether a large increase of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO2 could also destroy the habitability of water-rich planets has remained unclear. Here we show with three-dimensional aqua-planet simulations that CO2-induced forcing as readily destabilizes the climate as does solar forcing. The climate instability is caused by a positive cloud feedback and leads to a new steady state with global-mean sea-surface temperatures above 330\,K. The upper atmosphere is considerably moister in this warm state than in the reference climate, implying that the planet would be subject to substantial loss of water to space. For some elevated CO2 or solar forcings, we find both cold and warm equilibrium states, implying that the climate transition cannot be reversed by removing the additional forcing.},

  abstract = {In this brief communication we provide the rationale for and the outcome of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIXth General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants between solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar luminosity, solar effective temperature, and solar mass parameter) in the literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in 2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary, and fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU 2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are by definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work and publications to help minimize further confusion.},

This process involves the definition of science and mission requirements as well as a preliminary model payload, and an internal Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study providing the input to parallel industrial studies (in progress since 2016). After this process, the three candidates will be reviewed and in mid-2017 one of them will be selected as the M4 mission for launch in 2026. ARIEL is a survey-type mission dedicated to the characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. Using the differential technique of transit spectroscopy, ARIEL will obtain transmission and/or emission spectra of the atmospheres of a large and diverse sample of known exoplanets (\textasciitilde 500) covering a wide range of masses, densities, equilibrium temperatures, orbital properties and host-star characteristics. This will include hot Jupiters to warm Super-Earths, orbiting M5 to F0 stars. This paper describes critical requirements, and reports on the results of the Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study that was conducted in June / July 2015, providing a description of the resulting spacecraft design. It will employ a 0.7 m x 1.1 m off-axis three mirror telescope, feeding four photometric channels in the VNIR range (0.5-1.95 \&mu;m) and an IR spectrometer covering 1.95-7.8 \&mu;m.},

  abstract = {One of the long-term goals of exoplanet science is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small exoplanets in order to understand their diversity and search for habitable worlds and potential biosignatures. Achieving this goal requires a space mission of sufficient scale. We seek to quantify the exoplanet detection performance of a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer that measures the thermal emission of exoplanets. For this, we have developed an instrument simulator that considers all major astrophysical noise sources and coupled it with Monte Carlo simulations of a synthetic exoplanet population around main-sequence stars within 20 pc. This allows us to quantify the number (and types) of exoplanets that our mission concept could detect over a certain time period. Two different scenarios to distribute the observing time among the stellar targets are discussed and different apertures sizes and wavelength ranges are considered. Within a 2.5-year initial search phase, an interferometer consisting of four 2 m apertures with a total instrument throughput of 5\% covering a wavelength range between 4 and 18.5 \$\textbackslash mu\$m could detect up to \textasciitilde 550 exoplanets with radii between 0.5 and 6 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ with an integrated SNR\$\textbackslash ge\$7. At least \textasciitilde 160 of the detected exoplanets have radii \$\textbackslash le\$1.5 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$. Depending on the observing scenario, \textasciitilde 25-45 rocky exoplanets (objects with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 \$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$) orbiting within the empirical habitable zone (eHZ) of their host stars are among the detections. With an aperture size of 3.5 m, the total number of detections can increase to up to \textasciitilde 770, including \textasciitilde 60-80 rocky, eHZ planets. With 1 m aperture size, the maximum detection yield is \textasciitilde 315 exoplanets, including \$\textbackslash le\$20 rocky, eHZ planets. In terms of predicted detection yield, such a mission can compete with large single-aperture reflected light missions. (abridged)},

Here we report on two Saturn-mass planets orbiting TYC 2187-512-1 (\$M\_\textbackslash star = 0.50 M\_\textbackslash odot\$) and TZ Ari (\$M\_\textbackslash star = 0.15 M\_\textbackslash odot\$), respectively. We obtained supplementary photometric time series, which we use along with spectroscopic information to determine the rotation periods of the two stars. In both cases, the radial velocities also show strong modulations at the respective rotation period. We thus modeled the radial velocities as a Keplerian orbit plus a Gaussian process representing the stellar variability. TYC 2187-512-1 is found to harbor a planet with a minimum mass of 0.33 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$ in a near-circular 692-day orbit. The companion of TZ Ari has a minimum mass of 0.21 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$, orbital period of 771 d, and orbital eccentricity of 0.46. We provide an overview of all known giant planets in the CARMENES sample, from which we infer an occurrence rate of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs with periods up to 2 years in the range between 2\% to 6\%. TZ Ari b is only the second giant planet discovered orbiting a host with mass less than 0.3 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$. These objects occupy an extreme location in the planet mass versus host mass plane. It is difficult to explain their formation in core-accretion scenarios, so they may possibly have been formed through a disk fragmentation process.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3\textendash 5.5 {$\mu$}m stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude, and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find that stellar contamination can be more than 10\texttimes{} larger than the transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions and faculae covering fractions . The associated stellar contamination signals alter the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1\textendash 15\texttimes{} the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of the bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.},

The spatial distribution of liquid water and its change during the pre-main-sequence phase of protoplanetary systems is important for understanding how planets become habitable. Such worlds are interesting targets for future missions because the coolest stars could provide habitable conditions for up to 2.5 billion years post-accretion. Moreover, for a given star type, planetary systems are more easily resolved because of higher pre-main-sequence stellar luminosities, resulting in larger planet\textendash star separation for cool stars than is the case for the traditional main-sequence (MS) HZ. We use one-dimensional radiative\textendash convective climate and stellar evolutionary models to calculate pre-main-sequence HZ distances for F1-M8 stellar types. We also show that accreting planets that are later located in the traditional MS HZ orbiting stars cooler than a K5 (including the full range of M stars) receive stellar fluxes that exceed the runaway greenhouse threshold, and thus may lose substantial amounts of water initially delivered to them. We predict that M-star planets need to initially accrete more water than Earth did, or, alternatively, have additional water delivered later during the long pre-MS phase to remain habitable. Our findings are also consistent with recent claims that Venus lost its water during accretion.},

Our simulations include both planetary ``embryos'' (defined as Moon to Mars sized protoplanets) and planetesimals, assuming that the embryos formed via oligarchic growth. We investigate volatile delivery as a function of Jupiter's mass, position and eccentricity, the position of the snow line, and the density (in solids) of the solar nebula. In all simulations, we form 1\textendash 4 terrestrial planets inside 2 AU, which vary in mass and volatile content. In 44 simulations we have formed 43 planets between 0.8 and 1.5~AU, including 11 ``habitable'' planets between 0.9 and 1.1~AU. These planets range from dry worlds to ``water worlds'' with 100+oceans of water (1~ocean=1.5\texttimes 1024~g), and vary in mass between 0.23M{$\oplus$} and 3.85M{$\oplus$}. There is a good deal of stochastic noise in these simulations, but the most important parameter is the planetesimal mass we choose, which reflects the surface density in solids past the snow line. A high density in this region results in the formation of a smaller number of terrestrial planets with larger masses and higher water content, as compared with planets which form in systems with lower densities. We find that an eccentric Jupiter produces drier terrestrial planets with higher eccentricities than a circular one. In cases with Jupiter at 7 AU, we form what we call ``super embryos,'' 1\textendash 2M{$\oplus$} protoplanets which can serve as the accretion seeds for 2+M{$\oplus$} planets with large water contents.},

Even in the presence of Jupiter, water-rich material from beyond 2.5 AU is not accreted for several millions of years. (2) Even in the absence of secular resonances, the asteroid belt is cleared of {$>$}99\% of its original mass by self-scattering of bodies into resonances with Jupiter.

We use N-body simulations to show how perturbations from additional objects can break the multiresonant configuration by either triggering dynamical instability or simply removing the planets from resonance. The planets cannot have interacted with more than \textasciitilde 5\% of one Earth mass (M{$\oplus$}) in planetesimals\textemdash or a single rogue planet more massive than Earth's Moon\textemdash without disrupting their resonant orbital structure. This implies an upper limit of 10-4 M{$\oplus$} to 10-2\,M{$\oplus$} of late accretion on each planet since the dispersal of the system's gaseous disk. This is comparable to (or less than) the late accretion on Earth after the Moon-forming impact4,5, and demonstrates that the growth of the TRAPPIST-1 planets was complete in just a few million years, roughly an order of magnitude faster than that of the Earth6,7. Our results imply that any large water reservoirs on the TRAPPIST-1 planets must have been incorporated during their formation in the gaseous disk.},

  abstract = {The CARMENES instrument was conceived to deliver high-accuracy radial velocity (RV) measurements with long-term stability to search for temperate rocky planets around a sample of nearby cool stars. The broad wavelength coverage was designed to provide a range of stellar activity indicators to assess the nature of potential RV signals and to provide valuable spectral information to help characterise the stellar targets. The CARMENES Data Release 1 (DR1) makes public all observations obtained during the CARMENES guaranteed time observations, which ran from 2016 to 2020 and collected 19,633 spectra for a sample of 362 targets. The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed at minimising biases, and about 70\% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc and accessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, and high-level data products, including 18,642 precise RVs for 345 targets, were derived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were also obtained. We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statistical properties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We show examples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of the exoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17 re-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidate follow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planet occurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44+/-0.20 planets with 1 M\_Earth {$<$} M sin i {$<$} 1000 M\_Earth and 1 d {$<$} P\_orb {$<$} 1000 d per star, and indicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. CARMENES data have proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions as well as for additional applications, such as the determination of stellar properties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study of exoplanet atmospheres.},

  abstract = {Several transiting super-Earths are expected to be discovered in the coming few years. While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core, silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found.},

We calculate physically motivated mass-radius relations for sub-Neptunes, with rocky cores and H/He dominated atmospheres, accounting for their thermal evolution, irradiation and mass-loss. For planets \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\textasciitilde\$M\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$, we find that sub-Neptunes retain atmospheric mass fractions that scale with planet mass and show that the resulting mass-radius relations are degenerate with results for `water-worlds' consisting of a 1:1 silicate-to-ice composition ratio. We further demonstrate that our derived mass-radius relation is in excellent agreement with the observed exoplanet population orbiting M-dwarfs and that planet mass and radii alone are insufficient to determine the composition of some sub-Neptunes. Finally, we highlight that current exoplanet demographics show an increase in the ratio of super-Earths to sub-Neptunes with both stellar mass (and therefore luminosity) and age, which are both indicative of thermally driven atmospheric escape processes. Therefore, such processes should not be ignored when making compositional inferences in the mass-radius diagram.},

We find that of systems with a close-in, small planet also host an outer giant, compared to for stars irrespective of small planet presence. This implies that small planet hosts may be enhanced in outer giant occurrences compared to all stars with 1.7{$\sigma$} significance. Conversely, we estimate that of cold giant hosts also host an inner small planet, compared to of stars irrespective of cold giant presence. We also find that more massive and close-in giant planets are not associated with small inner planets. Specifically, our sample indicates that small planets are less likely to have outer giant companions more massive than approximately 120 M {$\oplus$} and within 0.3\textendash 3 au, than to have less massive or more distant giant companions, with {$\sim$}2.2{$\sigma$} confidence. This implies that massive gas giants within 0.3\textendash 3 au may suppress inner small planet formation. Additionally, we compare the host-star metallicity distributions for systems with only small planets and those with both small planets and cold giants. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stars in our survey that only host small planets have a metallicity distribution that is consistent with the broader solar-metallicity-median sample, while stars that host both small planets and gas giants are distinctly metal rich with {$\sim$}2.3{$\sigma$} confidence.},

Here we report a broad-wavelength 0.5-5.5 \$\textbackslash mu\$m atmospheric transmission spectrum of WASP-39 b, a 1200 K, roughly Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet, measured with JWST NIRSpec's PRISM mode as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team program.

The non-detection of CH\$\_4\$, combined with a strong CO\$\_2\$ feature, favours atmospheric models with a super-solar atmospheric metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature at 4\$\textbackslash mu\$m is best explained by SO\$\_2\$ (2.7\$\textbackslash sigma\$), which could be a tracer of atmospheric photochemistry.

  abstract = {The final orbital configuration of a planetary system is shaped by both its early star-disk environment and late-stage gravitational interactions. Assessing the relative importance of each of these factors is not straightforward due to the observed diversity of planetary systems compounded by observational biases. Our goal is to understand how a planetary system may change when planetesimal accretion and planet migrations stop and secular gravitational effects take over. Our approach starts with a novel classification of planetary systems based on their orbital architecture, validated using Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We apply this scheme to observed planetary systems and also to \$\textbackslash sim 400\$ synthetic systems hosting \$\textbackslash sim 5000\$ planets, synthesized from a Monte Carlo planet population model. Our classification scheme robustly yields four system classes according to their planet masses and semi-major axes, for both observed and synthetic systems. We then estimate the orbital distribution density of each of the synthetic systems before and after dynamically evolving them for up to 1 Myr with a gravitational+collisional \$N\$-body code. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to statistically measure orbital configuration changes, we find that \$\textbackslash lesssim 10 \textbackslash\%\$ of synthetic planetary systems experience such changes. We also find that this fraction belongs to a class of systems for which their center of mass is very close to their host star. Although changes in the orbital configuration of planetary systems may not very common, they are more likely to happen in systems with close-in, massive planets, with F- and G-type host-stars and stellar metallicities \$\textbackslash mathrm\{[Fe/H]\} {$>$} 0.2\$.},

  abstract = {Planetary atmospheres are commonly thought to result from the efficient outgassing of cooling magma oceans. During this stage, vigorous convective motions in the molten interior are believed to rapidly transport the dissolved volatiles to shallow depths where they exsolve and burst at the surface. This assumption of efficient degassing and atmosphere formation has important implications for planetary evolution, but has never been tested against fluid dynamics considerations. Yet, during a convective cycle, only a finite fraction of the magma ocean can reach the shallow depths where volatiles exsolution can occur, and a large-scale circulation may prevent a substantial magma ocean volume from rapidly reaching the planetary surface. Therefore, we conducted computational fluid dynamics experiments of vigorous 2D and 3D Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at Prandtl number of unity to characterize the ability of the convecting fluid to reach shallow depths at which volatiles are exsolved and extracted to the atmosphere. Outgassing efficiency is essentially a function of the magnitude of the convective velocities. This allows deriving simple expressions to predict the time evolution of the amount of outgassed volatiles as a function of the magma ocean governing parameters. For plausible cases, the time required to exsolve all oversaturated water can exceed the magma ocean lifetime in a given highly vigorous transient stage, leading to incomplete or even negligible outgassing. Furthermore, the planet size and the initial magma ocean water content, through the convective vigor and the exsolution depth, respectively, strongly affect magma oceans degassing efficiency, possibly leading to divergent planetary evolution paths and resulting surface conditions. Overall, despite vigorous convection, for a significant range of parameters, convective degassing appears not as efficient as previously thought.},

We developed a light-curve simulator named the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator (PSLS) in order to generate light-curves representative of typical PLATO targets, that is showing simultaneously solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, PSLS also aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of the PLATO multi-telescope concept.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected for PLATO. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board and also simulate the quasi-regular updates of the aperture masks during the observations. The simulated light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument point spread functions reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight calibration phases of the mission. These corrected and simulated light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in PSLS. Simulation of the oscillations and granulation signals rely on current state-of-the-art stellar seismology.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only at frequencies below {$\sim$}20 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}Hz. The systematic errors level is found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions with observations made by \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement with the observations.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. PSLS reproduces the main properties of expected PLATO light-curves. Its speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative of the PLATO cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the PLATO mission.}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Standard accretion disk models suggest that the snow line in the solar nebula migrated interior to the Earth's orbit in a late stage of nebula evolution. In this late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU from outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the question why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass being as small as 0.023\% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy pebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line assuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use a simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and radial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble accretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions presented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of terrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the strength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1 AU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while turbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos reside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023 wt\% only if the disk is compact ({$<$}100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and the snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2\textendash 4 Myr after disk formation. If the solar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved into icy planets of 1\textendash 10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow. If the proto-Earth contained water of \textasciitilde 1 wt\% as might be suggested by the density deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was possible with weaker turbulence and with earlier ({$>$}0.5\textendash 2 Myr) snow-line migration.},

However, the scientific expertise required for these activities is uncommon in the astronaut corps. PANGAEA (Planetary ANalogue Geological and Astrobiological Exercise for Astronauts) is a field training course designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) that addresses the topics of geological and astrobiological planetary exploration. The course intends to impart the essential basic theoretical and practical knowledge of geology and astrobiology, in order to prepare astronauts for advanced mission specific training. Significant focus is given to skills in areas relevant to future missions, such as scientific decision-making, working with a remotely located science team, and efficient documentation. For this reason, although portions of the course are taught in classrooms, developing independent field skills in analogue geological environments is a key part of the training. Classroom and field lessons are tightly interwoven in the course structure with a time separation often of only hours between being introduced to a concept in the classroom and seeing it in the field. The course forms part of the basic and pre-assignment training for European astronauts and is open to trainees from all other agencies. PANGAEA has been running since 2016, with participants including ESA and NASA astronauts, and Roscosmos cosmonauts, as well as mission designers, operations personnel and engineers. The primary field sites selected for the course are Permo-Triassic sedimentary sequences in the Italian Dolomites, impact lithologies in the Ries Crater, Germany, a comprehensive suite of volcanic deposits in Lanzarote, Spain, and anorthosite outcrops in Lofoten, Norway. Each is used as a base to deliver the main learning sessions, respectively: 1) Earth geology, rock recognition and sedimentology on Earth and Mars, 2) Lunar geology and impact cratering, 3) volcanism on Earth, Moon, and Mars, and astrobiology 4) intrusive rocks and lunar primordial crustal evolution. The four sessions are designed to increase trainee autonomy in field geology by including guided or autonomously executed geological traverses and practicing of sampling techniques. Whilst PANGAEA's primary focus is astronaut training, where appropriate and complementary to this training, technologies being developed for future missions are used and tested by the trainees during geological traverses. This provides an opportunity to evaluate the performance of new equipment and software in analogue field environments, whilst also providing trainees with experience using technology that might support future missions.},

The porous brine-saturated regolith3\textendash 5 would have created a physical space sheltered from ultraviolet and cosmic radiation and provided a solvent, whereas the below-ground temperature2 and diffusion6,7 of a dense, reduced atmosphere8,9 may have supported simple microbial organisms that consumed H2 and CO2 as energy and carbon sources and produced methane as a waste. On Earth, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was among the earliest metabolisms10,11, but its viability on early Mars has never been quantitatively evaluated. Here we present a probabilistic assessment of Mars' Noachian habitability to H2-based methanogens and quantify their biological feedback on Mars' atmosphere and climate. We find that subsurface habitability was very likely, and limited mainly by the extent of surface ice coverage. Biomass productivity could have been as high as in the early Earth's ocean. However, the predicted atmospheric composition shift caused by methanogenesis would have triggered a global cooling event, ending potential early warm conditions, compromising surface habitability and forcing the biosphere deep into the Martian crust. Spatial projections of our predictions point to lowland sites at low-to-medium latitudes as good candidates to uncover traces of this early life at or near the surface.},

In this paper, we study the interaction of a magma ocean with a water-rich atmosphere on GJ 1132b and determine that it must have begun with more than 5 wt\% initial water in order to still retain a water-based atmosphere. We also determine the amount of O2 that can build up in the atmosphere as a result of hydrogen dissociation and loss. We find that the magma ocean absorbs at most {$\sim$}10\% of the O2 produced, whereas more than 90\% is lost to space through hydrodynamic drag. The most common outcome for GJ 1132b from our simulations is a tenuous atmosphere dominated by O2, though, for very large initial water abundances, atmospheres with several thousands of bars of O2 are possible. A substantial steam envelope would indicate either the existence of an earlier H2 envelope or low XUV flux over the system's lifetime. A steam atmosphere would also imply the continued existence of a magma ocean on GJ 1132b. Further modeling is needed to study the evolution of CO2 or N2-rich atmospheres on GJ 1132b.},

  abstract = {Many protoplanetary discs are self-gravitating early in their lives. If they fragment under their own gravity, they form bound gaseous clumps which may evolve to become giant planets. Today, the fraction of discs that undergo fragmentation, and the frequency of conditions that may lead to giant planet formation via gravitational instability, is still unknown. We perform a population synthesis of discs from formation to dispersal. In varying the infall radius, we study the relationship of the early disc size with fragmentation. Furthermore, we investigate how stellar accretion heating affects the fragmentation fraction. We find that discs fragment only if they become sufficiently large early in their lives. This size depends sensitively on where mass is added to the discs during the collapse of their parent molecular cloud core. By choosing intermediate infall locations leading to a synthetic disc size distribution that is in agreement with the observed one, we find a fragmentation fraction between 0.1 and 11 \%, depending on the efficiency of stellar accretion heating of the discs. We conclude that the early disc size is mainly determined by the infall location during the collapse of the molecular cloud core and controls the population-wide frequency of fragmentation. Stellar accretion heating plays an important role for fragmentation and must be studied further. Our work is an observationally-informed step towards a prediction of the frequency of giant planet formation by gravitational instability. Upcoming observations and theoretical studies will deepen our understanding of the formation and early evolution of discs, eventually allowing to understand how infall, disc morphology, giant planet formation via gravitational instability, and the observed extrasolar planet population are linked.},

We attribute the discrepancy to warm and dynamically active giant planets that frequently disrupt the inner systems, particularly in high-metallicity environments. In general, a joint occurrence of the two planet types requires intermediate solid reservoirs in the originating protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, we find differences in the volatile content of planets in different system architectures and predict that high-density super-Earths are more likely to host an outer giant.

This comes at the cost of an increasing complexity of the models, which calls into question whether established links between their initial conditions and the calculated planetary observables are preserved.                                         Aims.               In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to investigate the relations between clusters of synthetic planets with similar properties and their formation history.                                         Methods.               We trained a Gaussian mixture model on typical exoplanet observables computed by a global model of planet formation to identify clusters of similar planets. We then traced back the formation histories of the planets associated with them and pinpointed their differences. Using the cluster affiliation as labels, we trained a random forest classifier to predict planet species from properties of the originating protoplanetary disk.                                         Results.               Without presupposing any planet types, we identified four distinct classes in our synthetic population. They roughly correspond to the observed populations of (sub-)Neptunes, giant planets, and (super-)Earths, plus an additional unobserved class we denote as ``icy cores''. These groups emerge already within the first 0.1 Myr of the formation phase and are predicted from disk properties with an overall accuracy of {$>$}90\%. The most reliable predictors are the initial orbital distance of planetary nuclei and the total planetesimal mass available. Giant planets form only in a particular region of this parameter space that is in agreement with purely analytical predictions. Including               N               -body interactions between the planets decreases the predictability, especially for sub-Neptunes that frequently undergo giant collisions and turn into super-Earths.                                         Conclusions.               The processes covered by current core accretion models of planet formation are largely predictable and reproduce the known demographic features in the exoplanet population. The impact of gravitational interactions highlights the need for               N               -body integrators for realistic predictions of systems of low-mass planets.},

  abstract = {\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We determine the radii and masses of 293 nearby, bright M dwarfs of the CARMENES survey. This is the first time that such a large and homogeneous high-resolution (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} {$>$} 80 000) spectroscopic survey has been used to derive these fundamental stellar parameters.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We derived the radii using Stefan\textendash Boltzmann's law. We obtained the required effective temperatures \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} from a spectral analysis and we obtained the required luminosities \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$} from integrated broadband photometry together with the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 parallaxes. The mass was then determined using a mass-radius relation that we derived from eclipsing binaries known in the literature. We compared this method with three other methods: (1) We calculated the mass from the radius and the surface gravity log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$}, which was obtained from the same spectral analysis as \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$}. (2) We used a widely used infrared mass-magnitude relation. (3) We used a Bayesian approach to infer stellar parameters from the comparison of the absolute magnitudes and colors of our targets with evolutionary models.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. Between spectral types M0 V and M7 V our radii cover the range 0.1 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.6 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} with an error of 2\textendash 3\% and our masses cover 0.09 {$\mathscr{M}$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} {$\mathscr{M}<$} 0.6{$\mathscr{M}$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} with an error of 3\textendash 5\%. We find good agreement between the masses determined with these different methods for most of our targets. Only the masses of very young objects show discrepancies. This can be well explained with the assumptions that we used for our methods.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} One of the most promising avenues for the detailed study of temperate Earth-sized exoplanets is the detection of such planets in transit in front of stars that are small and near enough to make it possible to carry out a thorough atmospheric characterisation with next-generation telescopes, such as the \emph{James Webb{$<$}i/{$>$} Space telescope (JWST) or Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). In this context, the TRAPPIST-1 planets form a unique benchmark system that has garnered the interest of a large scientific community.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The SPECULOOS survey is an exoplanet transit survey targeting a volume-limited (40 pc) sample of ultracool dwarf stars (of spectral type M7 and later) that is based on a network of robotic 1 m telescopes especially designed for this survey. The strategy for brighter and earlier targets leverages on the synergy with the ongoing TESS space-based exoplanet transit survey.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We define the SPECULOOS target list as the sum of three non-overlapping sub-programmes incorporating the latest type objects (\emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 3000 K). Programme 1 features 365 dwarfs that are small and near enough to make it possible to detail atmospheric characterisation of an `Earth-like' planet with the upcoming JWST. Programme 2 features 171 dwarfs of M5-type and later for which a significant detection of a planet similar to TRAPPIST-1b should be within reach of TESS. Programme 3 features 1121 dwarfs that are later than M6-type. These programmes form the basis of our statistical census of short-period planets around ultracool dwarf stars.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our compound target list includes 1657 photometrically classified late-type dwarfs, with 260 of these targets classified, for the first time, as possible nearby ultracool dwarf stars. Our general observational strategy was to monitor each target between 100 and 200 h with our telescope network, making efficient use of the synergy with TESS for our Programme 2 targets and a proportion of targets in our Programme 1.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we expect to detect up to a few dozen temperate, rocky planets. We also expect a number of them to prove amenable for atmospheric characterisation with JWST and other future giant telescopes, which will substantially improve our understanding of the planetary population of the latest-type stars.}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Recent observations have uncovered a correlation between the accretion rates (measured from the UV continuum excess) of protoplanetary discs and their masses inferred from observations of the submm continuum. While viscous evolution models predict such a correlation, the predicted values are in tension with data obtained from the Lupus and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions; for example, they underpredict the scatter in accretion rates, particularly in older regions. Here, we argue that since the submm observations trace the discs' dust, by explicitly modelling the dust grain growth, evolution, and emission, we can better understand the correlation. We show that for turbulent viscosities with {$\alpha$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 10-3, the depletion of dust from the disc due to radial drift means we can reproduce the range of masses and accretion rates seen in the Lupus and Upper Sco data sets. One consequence of this model is that the upper locus of accretion rates at a given dust mass does not evolve with the age of the region. Moreover, we find that internal photoevaporation is necessary to produce the lowest accretion rates observed. In order to replicate the correct dust masses at the time of disc dispersal, we favour relatively low photoevaporation rates {$\lessequivlnt$} 10-9~M{$\odot~$}yr-1 for most sources but cannot discriminate between EUV or X-ray-driven winds. A limited number of sources, particularly in Lupus, are shown to have higher masses than predicted by our models which may be evidence for variations in the properties of the dust or dust trapping induced in substructures.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} The discovery of low density exoplanets in the super-Earth mass regime suggests that ocean planets could be abundant in the galaxy. Understanding the chemical interactions between water and Mg-silicates or iron is essential for constraining the interiors of water-rich planets. Hydration effects have, however, been mostly neglected by the astrophysics community so far. As such effects are unlikely to have major impacts on theoretical mass-radius relations, this is justified as long as the measurement uncertainties are large. However, upcoming missions, such as the PLATO mission (scheduled launch 2026), are envisaged to reach a precision of up to {$\approx$}3 and {$\approx$}10\% for radii and masses, respectively. As a result, we may soon enter an area in exoplanetary research where various physical and chemical effects such as hydration can no longer be ignored.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our goal is to construct interior models for planets that include reliable prescriptions for hydration of the cores and mantles. These models can be used to refine previous results for which hydration has been neglected and to guide future characterization of observed exoplanets.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We have developed numerical tools to solve for the structure of multi-layered planets with variable boundary conditions and compositions. Here we consider three types of planets: dry interiors, hydrated interiors, and dry interiors plus surface ocean, where the ocean mass fraction corresponds to the mass fraction of the H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O equivalent in the hydrated case.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find H and OH storage capacities in the hydrated planets equivalent to 0-6 wt\% H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O corresponding to up to {$\approx$}800 km deep ocean layers. In the mass range 0.1 {$\leq$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>\leq$} 3, the effect of hydration on the total radius is found to be {$\leq$}2.5\%, whereas the effect of separation into an isolated surface ocean is {$\leq$}5\%. Furthermore, we find that our results are very sensitive to the bulk composition.}}}}}}}}}},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

We carry out a first analysis of the science that is possible with this sample to demonstrate its potential and best practices for its use.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} Theselection of objects within 100 pc from the full catalogue used selected training sets, machine-learning procedures, astrometric quantities, and solution quality indicators to determine a probability that the astrometric solution is reliable. The training set construction exploited the astrometric data, quality flags, and external photometry. For all candidates we calculated distance posterior probability densities using Bayesian procedures and mock catalogues to define priors. Any object with reliable astrometry and a non-zero probability of being within 100 pc is included in the catalogue.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We have produced a catalogue of 331 312 objects that we estimate contains at least 92\% of stars of stellar type M9 within 100 pc of the Sun. We estimate that 9\% of the stars in this catalogue probably lie outside 100 pc, but when the distance probability function is used, a correct treatment of this contamination is possible. We produced luminosity functions with a high signal-to-noise ratio for the main-sequence stars, giants, and white dwarfs. We examined in detail the Hyades cluster, the white dwarf population, and wide-binary systems and produced candidate lists for all three samples. We detected local manifestations of several streams, superclusters, and halo objects, in which we identified 12 members of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Enceladus.

  abstract = {Cool M dwarfs within a few tens of parsecs from the Sun are becoming the focus of dedicated observational programs in the realm of exoplanet astrophysics. Gaia, in its all-sky survey of \&gt;109 objects, will deliver precision astrometry for a magnitude-limited (V~=~20) sample of M dwarfs. We investigate some aspects of the synergy between the Gaia astrometric data on nearby M dwarfs and other ground-based and space-borne programs for planet detection and characterization. We carry out numerical simulations to gauge the Gaia potential for precision astrometry of exoplanets orbiting a sample of known dM stars within~{$\sim$}30\,pc from the Sun. We express Gaia detection thresholds as a function of system parameters and in view of the latest mission profile, including the most up-to-date astrometric error model. Our major findings are as follows: (1) it will be possible to accurately determine orbits and masses for Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods in the range 0.2~{$\lessequivlnt~$}P~{$\lessequivlnt~$}6.0~yr and with an astrometric signal-to-noise ratio {$\varsigma$}/{$\sigma$}AL~{$\greaterequivlnt~$}10. Given present-day estimates of the planet fraction fp around M dwarfs, {$\approx$}102 giant planets could be found by Gaia around the sample. Comprehensive screening by Gaia of the reservoir of~{$\sim$}4~\texttimes ~105 M dwarfs within 100\,pc could result in~{$\sim$}2600 detections and as many as~{$\sim$}500 accurate orbit determinations. The value of fp could then be determined with an accuracy of 2~per\,cent, an improvement by over an order of magnitude with respect to the most precise values available to-date; (2) in the same period range, inclination angles corresponding to quasi-edge-on configurations will be determined with enough precision (a few~per\,cent) so that it will be possible to identify intermediate-separation planets which are potentially transiting within the errors. Gaia could alert us of the existence of 10 such systems. More than 250 candidates could be identified assuming solutions compatible with transit configurations within 10~per\,cent accuracy, although a large fraction of these ({$\sim$}85~per\,cent) could be false positives; (3) for well-sampled orbits, the uncertainties on planetary ephemerides, separation {$\varrho$} and position angle \textvartheta{} will degrade at typical rates of {$\Delta\varrho~\&$}lt;~1~mas~yr-1 and {$\Delta\vartheta ~\&$}lt;~2\textdegree ~yr-1, respectively. These are over an order of magnitude smaller than the degradation levels attained by present-day ephemerides predictions based on mas-level precision Hubble Space Telescope/Fine Guidance Sensor astrometry; (4) planetary phases will be measured with typical uncertainties {$\Delta\lambda$} of several degrees, resulting (under the assumption of purely scattering atmospheres) in phase-averaged errors on the phase function {$\Delta\Phi$}({$\lambda$}) {$\approx$} 0.05, and expected uncertainties in the determination of the emergent flux of intermediate-separation (0.3~\&lt;~a~\&lt;~2.0~au) giant planets of~{$\sim$}20~per\,cent. Our results help to quantify the actual relevance of the Gaia astrometric observations of the large sample of nearby M dwarfs in a synergetic effort to optimize the planning and interpretation of follow-up/characterization measurements of the discovered systems by means of transit survey programs, and upcoming and planned ground-based as well as space-borne observatories for direct imaging (e.g. Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research, European Extremely Large Telescope/Planetary Camera and Spectrograph) and simultaneous multiwavelength spectroscopy (e.g. Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory, James Webb Space Telescope).},

  abstract = {The class of transiting cold Jupiters, orbiting at {$\greaterequivlnt$}0.5\textendash 1.0\,au, is to-date underpopulated. Probing their atmospheric composition and physical characteristics is particularly valuable, as it allows for direct comparisons with the Solar system giant planets. We investigate some aspects of the synergy between Gaia astrometry and other ground-based and space-borne programs for detection and characterization of such companions. We carry out numerical simulations of Gaia observations of systems with one cold transiting gas giant, using Jovian planets around a sample of nearby low-mass stars as proxies. Using state-of-the-art orbit fitting tools, we gauge the potential of Gaia astrometry to predict the time of transit centre Tc for the purpose of follow-up observations to verify that the companions are indeed transiting. Typical uncertainties on Tc will be on the order of a few months, reduced to several weeks for high astrometric signal-to-noise ratios and periods shorter than {$\sim$}3\,yr. We develop a framework for the combined analysis of Gaia astrometry and radial-velocity data from representative ground-based campaigns and show that combined orbital fits would allow to significantly reduce the transit windows to be searched for, down to about {$\pm$}2 weeks (2\textendash{$\sigma$} level) in the most favourable cases. These results are achievable with a moderate investment of observing time ({$\sim$}0.5 nights per candidate, {$\sim$}50 nights for the top 100 candidates), reinforcing the notion that Gaia astrometric detections of potentially transiting cold giant planets, starting with Data Release 4, will constitute a valuable sample worthy of synergistic follow-up efforts with a variety of techniques.},

We provide an overview of Nested Sampling, its extension to Dynamic Nested Sampling, the algorithmic challenges involved, and the various approaches taken to solve them in this and previous work. We then examine dynesty's performance on a variety of toy problems along with several astronomical applications. We find in particular problems dynesty can provide substantial improvements in sampling efficiency compared to popular MCMC approaches in the astronomical literature.

  abstract = {This report describes the 2014 study by the Science Definition Team (SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

  abstract = {The dozens of rocky exoplanets discovered in the Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) currently represent the most suitable places to host life as we know it outside the Solar System. However, the presumed presence of liquid water on the CHZ planets does not guarantee suitable environments for the emergence of life. According to experimental studies, the building blocks of life are most likely produced photochemically in presence of a minimum ultraviolet (UV) flux. On the other hand, high UV flux can be life-threatening, leading to atmospheric erosion and damaging biomolecules essential to life. These arguments raise questions about the actual habitability of CHZ planets around stars other than Solar-type ones, with different UV to bolometric luminosity ratios. By combining the "principle of mediocricy" and recent experimental studies, we define UV boundary conditions (UV-habitable Zone, UHZ) within which life can possibly emerge and evolve. We investigate whether exoplanets discovered in CHZs do indeed experience such conditions. By analysing Swift-UV/Optical Telescope data, we measure the near ultraviolet (NUV) luminosities of 17 stars harbouring 23 planets in their CHZ. We derive an empirical relation between NUV luminosity and stellar effective temperature. We find that eighteen of the CHZ exoplanets actually orbit outside the UHZ, i.e., the NUV luminosity of their M-dwarf hosts is decisively too low to trigger abiogenesis - through cyanosulfidic chemistry - on them. Only stars with effective temperature {$>$}3900 K illuminate their CHZ planets with enough NUV radiation to trigger abiogenesis. Alternatively, colder stars would require a high-energy flaring activity.},

  abstract = {Over the last years, large (sub-)millimetre surveys of protoplanetary disks have well constrained the demographics of disks, such as their millimetre luminosities, spectral indices, and disk radii. Additionally, several high-resolution observations have revealed an abundance of substructures in the disks dust continuum. The most prominent are ring like structures, likely due to pressure bumps trapping dust particles. The origins and characteristics of these bumps, nevertheless, need to be further investigated. The purpose of this work is to study how dynamic pressure bumps affect observational properties of protoplanetary disks. We further aim to differentiate between the planetary- versus zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps. We perform one-dimensional gas and dust evolution simulations, setting up models with varying pressure bump features. We subsequently run radiative transfer calculations to obtain synthetic images and the different quantities of observations. We find that the outermost pressure bump determines the disks dust size across different millimetre wavelengths. Our modelled dust traps need to form early ({$<$} 0.1 Myr), fast (on viscous timescales), and must be long lived ({$>$} Myr) to obtain the observed high millimetre luminosities and low spectral indices of disks. While the planetary bump models can reproduce these observables irrespectively of the opacity prescription, the highest opacities are needed for the zonal flow bump model to be in line with observations. Our findings favour the planetary- over the zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps and support the idea that planet formation already occurs in early class 0-1 stages of circumstellar disks. The determination of the disks effective size through its outermost pressure bump also delivers a possible answer to why disks in recent low-resolution surveys appear to have the same sizes across different millimetre wavelengths.},

Rapid formation of Jupiter's core within one million years after CAIs has been suggested as a potential mechanism for spatial and temporal separation. In this scenario, Jupiter's core would open a gap in the disk and trap inwards-drifting dust grains in the pressure bump at the outer edge of the gap, separating the inner and outer disk materials from each other. We performed simulations of dust particles in a protoplanetary disk with a gap opened by an early formed Jupiter core, including dust growth and fragmentation as well as dust transport using the dust evolution software DustPy. Our numerical experiments indicate that particles trapped in the outer edge of the gap rapidly fragment and are transported through the gap, contaminating the inner disk with outer disk materials on a timescale that is inconsistent with the meteoritic record. This suggests that other processes must have initiated or at least contributed to the isotopic separation between the inner and outer Solar System.},

Here, we perform stellar cluster simulations of 3-planet and 7-planet systems containing super-Earths on initially circular, coplanar orbits. We adopt the typical stellar masses of main-sequence progenitors of white dwarfs (\$1.5\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$-\$2.5\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) as host stars and include 8,000 main-sequence stars following a Kroupa initial mass function in our clusters. Our results reveal that about 30 per cent of the simulated planets generate eccentricities of at least 0.1 by the time of cluster dissolution, which would aid white dwarf pollution. We provide our output parameters to the community for potential use as initial conditions for subsequent evolution simulations.},

The design addresses the 2011 Decadal Survey's recommendation for a New Frontiers class mission to Io and is based upon the result of the June 2012 NASA-JPL Planetary Science Summer School. A science payload is proposed to investigate the link between the structure of Io's interior, its volcanic activity, its surface composition, and its tectonics. A study of Io's atmospheric processes and Io's role in the Jovian magnetosphere is also planned. The instrument suite includes a visible/near-IR imager, a magnetic field and plasma suite, a dust analyzer, and a gimbaled high gain antenna to perform radio science. Payload activity and spacecraft operations would be powered by three Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRG). The primary mission includes 10 flybys with close-encounter altitudes as low as 100km. The mission risks are mitigated by ensuring that relevant components are radiation tolerant and by using redundancy and flight-proven parts in the design. The spacecraft would be launched on an Atlas V rocket with a delta-v of 1.3km/s. Three gravity assists (Venus, Earth, Earth) would be used to reach the Jupiter system in a 6-year cruise. The resulting concept demonstrates the rich scientific return of a flyby mission to Io.},

  abstract = {The search for water-rich Earth-sized exoplanets around low-mass stars is rapidly gaining attention because they represent the best opportunity to characterize habitable planets in the near future. Understanding the atmospheres of these planets and determining the optimal strategy for characterizing them through transmission spectroscopy with our upcoming instrumentation is essential in order to constrain their environments. For this study, we present simulated transmission spectra of tidally locked Earth-sized ocean-covered planets around late-M to mid-K stellar spectral types, utilizing the results of general circulation models previously published by Kopparapu et al. as inputs for our radiative transfer calculations performed using NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator (psg.gsfc.nasa.gov). We identify trends in the depth of H2O spectral features as a function of planet surface temperature and rotation rate. These trends allow us to calculate the exposure times necessary to detect water vapor in the atmospheres of aquaplanets through transmission spectroscopy with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope as well as several future flagship space telescope concepts under consideration (the Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor and the Origins Space Telescope) for a target list constructed from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Input Catalog (TIC). Our calculations reveal that transmission spectra for water-rich Earth-sized planets around low-mass stars will be dominated by clouds, with spectral features {$<$}20 ppm, and only a small subset of TIC stars would allow for the characterization of an ocean planet in the habitable zone. We thus present a careful prioritization of targets that are most amenable to follow-up characterizations with next-generation instrumentation, in order to assist the community in efficiently utilizing precious telescope time.},

The core accretion theory's runaway gas accretion process predicts a dearth of intermediate-mass giant planets that is not seen in the microlensing results. In particular, the models predict {$\sim$} 10 \texttimes{} fewer planets at mass ratios of 10-4 {$\leq$} q {$\leq$} 4 \texttimes{} 10-4 than inferred from microlensing observations. This tension implies that gas giant formation may involve processes that have hitherto been overlooked by existing core accretion models or that the planet-forming environment varies considerably as a function of host-star mass. Variation from the usual assumptions for the protoplanetary disk viscosity and thickness could reduce this discrepancy, but such changes might conflict with microlensing results at larger or smaller mass ratios, or with other observations. The resolution of this discrepancy may have important implications for planetary habitability because it has been suggested that the runaway gas accretion process may have triggered the delivery of water to our inner solar system. So, an understanding of giant planet formation may help us to determine the occurrence rate of habitable planets.},

The branch of sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets is censored by the orbital period at the large-radius end: no planets with mass between 0.02 and 0.8 MJ or with radius between 0.25 and 1.0 RJ are known with Porb {$<$} 2.5 days. This clustering is not predicted by current theories of planet formation and evolution, which we also review briefly.},

Owing to the sensitivity limits of the currently used detection techniques, these planets populate zones restricted either to the solar neighbourhood or towards the galactic bulge. This selection problem prevents us from unveiling the true galactic planetary population and is not set to change for the next two decades. Here, we present a detection method that overcomes this issue and that will allow us to detect massive exoplanets using gravitational-wave astronomy. We show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission can characterize new circumbinary exoplanets orbiting white dwarf binaries everywhere in our Galaxy\textemdash a population of exoplanets so far completely unprobed\textemdash as well as detecting extragalactic bound exoplanets in the Magellanic Clouds. Such a method is not limited by stellar activity and, in extremely favourable cases, will allow LISA to detect planets down to 50\,Earth masses.},

We consider multiple approaches for simulating M3-T9 sources within the survey fields, including scaling local space densities and using Galactic stellar population synthesis models. These approaches independently predict \$\textbackslash sim\$100,000 single mid-M dwarfs and UCDs brighter than a Roman F146 magnitude of 21 that are within the survey fields. Assuming planet occurrence statistics previously measured for early-to-mid M dwarfs, we predict that the survey will discover 1347\$\^\{+208\}\_\{-124\}\$ small transiting planets around these sources, each to a significance of 7.1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ or greater. Significant departures from this prediction would test whether the occurrence rates of small planets increase or decrease around mid-M dwarfs and UCDs compared to early-M dwarfs. We predict the detection of 13\$\^\{+4\}\_\{-3\}\$ habitable, terrestrial planets (\$R\_p{$<\$$}1.23 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$) in the survey. However, atmospheric characterization of these planets will be challenging with current or near-future space telescope facilities due to the faintness of the host stars. Nevertheless, accurate statistics for the occurrence of small planets around mid-M dwarfs and UCDs will enable direct tests of predictions from planet formation theories and will determine our understanding of planet demographics around the objects at the bottom of the main sequence. This understanding is critical given the prevalence of such objects in our Galaxy, whose planets may therefore comprise the bulk of the galactic census of exoplanets.},

The advent of Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys has now made it possible, in principle, to infer the properties of individual stars, including most exoplanet hosts, to very high precision. However, we show that, in practice, such analyses are limited by uncertainties in both the fundamental scale and our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured interferometric angular diameters and bolometric fluxes set a systematic uncertainty floor of {$\asymp$}2.4\% in temperature, {$\asymp$}2.0\% in luminosity, and {$\asymp$}4.2\% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest uncertainties of order {$\asymp$}5\% in mass and {$\asymp$}20\% in age for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While the radius uncertainties are roughly constant over this range of stars, the model-dependent uncertainties are a complex function of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets and discuss strategies for reducing these uncertainties in the future.},

The {$\sim$}10 yr baseline between the event and the Keck observations allows the planetary host star to be detected at a separation of 66.5 {$\pm$} 1.7 mas from the source star, consistent with the light-curve model prediction. The combination of the host star brightness and light-curve parameters yields host star and planet masses of Mhost = 0.524 {$\pm$} 0.048M{$\odot$} and mp = 67.3 {$\pm$} 6.2M{$\oplus$} at a distance of DL = 7.1 {$\pm$} 0.7 kpc. The star-planet projected separation is 2.03 {$\pm$} 0.21 au. The planet-to-star mass ratio of this system, q = (3.857 {$\pm$} 0.029) \texttimes{} 10-4, places it in the predicted "planet desert" at 10-4 {$<$} q {$<$} 4 \texttimes{} 10-4 according to the runaway gas accretion scenario of the core accretion theory. Seven of the 30 planets in the Suzuki et al. sample fall in this mass ratio range, and this is the third with a measured host mass. All three of these host stars have masses of 0.5 {$\leq$} Mhost/M{$\odot$} {$\leq$} 0.7, which implies that this predicted mass ratio gap is filled with planets that have host stars within a factor of two of 1M{$\odot$}. This suggests that runaway gas accretion does not play a major role in determining giant planet masses for stars somewhat less massive than the Sun. Our analysis has been accomplished with a modified DAOPHOT code that has been designed to measure the brightness and positions of closely blended stars. This will aid in the development of the primary method that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope mission will use to determine the masses of microlens planets and their hosts.},

  abstract = {Observational advancements are leading to increasingly precise measurements of super-Earth masses and radii. Such measurements are used in internal structure models to constrain interior compositions of super-Earths. It is now critically important to quantify the effect of various model assumptions on the predicted radii. In particular, models often neglect thermal effects, a choice justified by noting that the thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is small. However, the thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be significant. We have systematically explored the extent to which thermal effects can influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of masses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass fractions. We developed temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich super-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation of state. We found that thermal effects induce significant changes in their radii. For example, for super-Earths with 10~per~cent water by mass, the radius increases by up to 0.5~R{$\oplus$} when the surface temperature is increased from 300 to 1000~K, assuming a surface pressure of 100~bar and an adiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer. The increase is even larger at lower surface pressures and/or higher surface temperatures, while changing the water fraction makes only a marginal difference. These effects are comparable to current super-Earth radial measurement errors, which can be better than 0.1~R{$\oplus$}. It is therefore important to ensure that the thermal behaviour of water is taken into account when interpreting super-Earth radii using internal structure models.},

The catalog contains 8054 KOIs, of which 4034 are planet candidates with periods between 0.25 and 632 days. Of these candidates, 219 are new, including two in multiplanet systems (KOI-82.06 and KOI-2926.05) and 10 high-reliability, terrestrial-size, habitable zone candidates. This catalog was created using a tool called the Robovetter, which automatically vets the DR25 threshold crossing events (TCEs). The Robovetter also vetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEs caused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discuss the Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods less than 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transits that are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars is greater than 85\%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (the fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) is greater than 98\%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and 500 days around FGK-dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7\% complete and the catalog is 50.5\% reliable. The KOI catalog, the transit fits, and all of the simulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.},

  abstract = {More than three decades have passed since the publication of the last review of the Venus clouds and hazes. The paper published in 1983 in the Venus book summarized the discoveries and findings of the US Pioneer Venus and a series of Soviet Venera spacecraft (Esposito et al. in Venus, p.~484, 1983). Due to the emphasis on in-situ investigations from descent probes, those missions established the basic features of the Venus cloud system, its vertical structure, composition and microphysical properties. Since then, significant progress in understanding of the Venus clouds has been achieved due to exploitation of new observation techniques onboard Galileo and Messenger flyby spacecraft and Venus Express and Akatsuki orbiters. They included detailed investigation of the mesospheric hazes in solar and stellar occultation geometry applied in the broad spectral range from UV to thermal IR. Imaging spectroscopy in the near-IR transparency ``windows'' on the night side opened a new and very effective way of sounding the deep atmosphere. This technique together with near-simultaneous UV imaging enabled comprehensive study of the cloud morphology from the cloud top to its deep layers. Venus Express operated from April 2006 until December 2014 and provided a continuous data set characterizing Venus clouds and hazes over a time span of almost 14 Venus years thus enabling a detailed study of temporal and spatial variability. The polar orbit of Venus Express allowed complete latitudinal coverage. These studies are being complemented by JAXA Akatsuki orbiter that began observations in May 2016. This paper reviews the current status of our knowledge of the Venus cloud system focusing mainly on the results acquired after the Venera, Pioneer Venus and Vega missions.},

This is the largest multiwavelength survey of protostars at this resolution by an order of magnitude. We use the dust continuum emission at 0.87 and 9 mm to measure the dust disk radii and masses toward the Class 0, Class I, and flat-spectrum protostars, characterizing the evolution of these disk properties in the protostellar phase. The mean dust disk radii for the Class 0, Class I, and flat-spectrum protostars are , , and au, respectively, and the mean protostellar dust disk masses are 25.9, , , respectively. The decrease in dust disk masses is expected from disk evolution and accretion, but the decrease in disk radii may point to the initial conditions of star formation not leading to the systematic growth of disk radii or that radial drift is keeping the dust disk sizes small. At least 146 protostellar disks (35\% of 379 detected 0.87 mm continuum sources plus 42 nondetections) have disk radii greater than 50 au in our sample. These properties are not found to vary significantly between different regions within Orion. The protostellar dust disk mass distributions are systematically larger than those of Class II disks by a factor of {$>$}4, providing evidence that the cores of giant planets may need to at least begin their formation during the protostellar phase.},

The ESO VISTA 4.1 m telescope with the VIRCAM instrument observed both satellites on 5 Mar. 2020 (UTC) and 7 Mar. 2020 (UTC) in the NIR \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$}-band and \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$}-band, respectively.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} The calibration, image processing, and analysis of the Darksat images give \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 5.6 mag, \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 5.0 mag, \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.2 mag, and \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.0 mag when scaled to a range of 550 km (airmass = 1) and corrected for the solar incidence and observer phase angles. In comparison, the STARLINK-1113 images give \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.9 mag, \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 4.4 mag, \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 3.8 mag, and \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 3.6 mag when corrected for range, solar incidence, and observer phase angles. The data and results presented in this work show that the special darkening coating used by Starlink for Darksat has darkened the Sloan \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>{'}$} magnitude by 50\%, Sloan \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>{'}$} magnitude by 42\%, NIR \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} magnitude by 32\%, and NIR \emph{Ks{$<$}i/{$>$} magnitude by 28\%.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The results show that both satellites increase in reflective brightness with increasing wavelength and that the effectiveness of the darkening treatment is reduced at longer wavelengths. This shows that the mitigation strategies being developed by Starlink and other LEO satellite operators need to take into account other wavelengths, not just the optical. This work highlights the continued importance of obtaining multi-wavelength observations of many different LEO satellites in order to characterise their reflective properties and to aid the community in developing impact simulations and developing mitigation tools.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarised, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

  abstract = {Planets similar to Earth but slightly more irradiated are expected to enter into a runaway greenhouse state, where all surface water rapidly evaporates, forming an optically thick H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O-dominated atmosphere. For Earth, this extreme climate transition is thought to occur for an increase of only \textasciitilde 6\% in solar luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would occur is still a highly debated topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is believed to be a fundamental process in the evolution of Earth-sized, temperate planets. Using 1D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting for thick, hot water vapor-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit atmospheric thickness of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and find that it could possibly reach over a thousand kilometers (i.e., a few tens of percent of the Earth's radius). This abrupt radius inflation resulting from the runaway-greenhouse-induced transition could be detected statistically by ongoing and upcoming space missions. These include satellites such as TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO combined with precise radial velocity mass measurements using ground-based spectrographs such as ESPRESSO, CARMENES, or SPIRou. This radius inflation could also be detected in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1 once masses and radii are known with good enough precision. This result provides the community with an observational test of two points. The first point is the concept of runaway greenhouse, which defines the inner edge of the traditional habitable zone, and the exact limit of the runaway greenhouse transition. In particular, this could provide an empirical measurement of the irradiation at which Earth analogs transition from a temperate to a runaway greenhouse climate state. This astronomical measurement would make it possible to statistically estimate how close Earth is from the runaway greenhouse. Second, it could be used as a test for the presence (and statistical abundance) of water in temperate, Earth-sized exoplanets.}},

  abstract = {Mass-radius relationships for water-rich rocky planets are usually calculated assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships, even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.1 times the insolation at Earth for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and would instead form a thick H\textsubscript{2}O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use a 1-D radiative-convective inverse version of the LMD generic numerical climate model to derive new theoretical mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. As a result of the runaway greenhouse radius inflation effect introduced in previous work, these new mass-radius relationships significantly differ from those traditionally used in the literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate -possibly by several orders of magnitude- their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08\%, respectively, assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show that significant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Broadly speaking, our results demonstrate that non-H\textsubscript{2}/He-dominated atmospheres can have a first-order effect on the mass-radius relationships, even for rocky planets receiving moderate irradiation. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H\textsubscript{2}O steam atmosphere thickness as a function of planet core gravity and radius, water content, and irradiation. This formula can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky planet (i.e., with any kind of interior composition ranging from pure iron to pure silicate) more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.},

The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models3 that cannot account for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds\textemdash which preferentially form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption\textemdash have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even at modest insolations (down to 325\,watts per square metre, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the formation of Earth's oceans required much lower insolation than today, which was made possible by the faint young Sun. This also implies the existence of another stability state for present-day Earth: the `steam Earth', with all the water from the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere.},

TOI-1246 is one such system, with a moderately bright K dwarf (\$\textbackslash rm\{V=11.6,\textasciitilde K=9.9\}\$) and four transiting sub-Neptunes identified by TESS with orbital periods of \$4.31\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\},\textasciitilde 5.90\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\},\textasciitilde 18.66\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\}\$, and \$\textasciitilde 37.92\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{d\}\$. We collected 130 radial velocity observations with Keck/HIRES and TNG/HARPS-N to measure planet masses. We refit the 14 sectors of TESS photometry to refine planet radii (\$\textbackslash rm\{2.97 \textbackslash pm 0.06\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\},\textbackslash rm\{2.47 \textbackslash pm 0.08\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\}, \textbackslash rm\{3.46 \textbackslash pm 0.09\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{3.72 \textbackslash pm 0.16\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$), and confirm the four planets. We find that TOI-1246 e is substantially more massive than the three inner planets (\$\textbackslash rm\{8.1 \textbackslash pm 1.1 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{8.8 \textbackslash pm 1.2 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{5.3 \textbackslash pm 1.7 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm\{14.8 \textbackslash pm 2.3 M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$). The two outer planets, TOI-1246 d and TOI-1246 e, lie near to the 2:1 resonance (\$\textbackslash rm\{P\_\{e\}/P\_\{d\}=2.03\}\$) and exhibit transit timing variations. TOI-1246 is one of the brightest four-planet systems, making it amenable for continued observations. It is one of only six systems with measured masses and radii for all four transiting planets. The planet densities range from \$\textbackslash rm\{0.70 \textbackslash pm 0.24\}\$ to \$3.21 \textbackslash pm 0.44 \textbackslash rm\{g/cm\^3\}\$, implying a range of bulk and atmospheric compositions. We also report a fifth planet candidate found in the RV data with a minimum mass of 25.6 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 3.6 \$\textbackslash rm\{M\_\textbackslash oplus\}\$. This planet candidate is exterior to TOI-1246 e with a candidate period of 93.8 d, and we discuss the implications if it is confirmed to be planetary in nature.},

  abstract = {The Subaru telescope is currently performing a strategic program (SSP) using the high-precision near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer IRD to search for exoplanets around nearby mid/late-M\textasciitilde dwarfs via radial velocity (RV) monitoring. As part of the observing strategy for the exoplanet survey, signatures of massive companions such as RV trends are used to reduce the priority of those stars. However, this RV information remains useful for studying the stellar multiplicity of nearby M\textasciitilde dwarfs. To search for companions around such ``deprioritized" M\textasciitilde dwarfs, we observed 14 IRD-SSP targets using Keck/NIRC2 observations with pyramid wavefront sensing at NIR wavelengths, leading to high sensitivity to substellar-mass companions within a few arcseconds. We detected two new companions (LSPM\textasciitilde J1002+1459\textasciitilde B and LSPM\textasciitilde J2204+1505\textasciitilde B) and two new candidates that are likely companions (LSPM\textasciitilde J0825+6902\textasciitilde B and LSPM\textasciitilde J1645+0444\textasciitilde B) as well as one known companion. Including two known companions resolved by the IRD fiber injection module camera, we detected seven (four new) companions at projected separations between \$\textbackslash sim2-20\$\textasciitilde au in total. A comparison of the colors with the spectral library suggests that LSPM\textasciitilde J2204+1505\textasciitilde B and LSPM\textasciitilde J0825+6902\textasciitilde B are located at the boundary between late-M and early-L spectral types. Our deep high-contrast imaging for targets where no bright companions were resolved did not reveal any additional companion candidates. The NIRC2 detection limits could constrain potential substellar-mass companions (\$\textbackslash sim10-75\textbackslash{} M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$) at 10\textasciitilde au or further. The failure with Keck/NIRC2 around the IRD-SSP stars having significant RV trends makes these objects promising targets for further RV monitoring or deeper imaging with JWST to search for smaller-mass companions below the NIRC2 detection limits.},

  abstract = {The Kepler and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions have generated over 100,000 potential transit signals that must be processed in order to create a catalog of planet candidates. During the past few years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning to analyze these data in search of new exoplanets. Different from the existing machine learning works, ExoMiner, the proposed deep learning classifier in this work, mimics how domain experts examine diagnostic tests to vet a transit signal. ExoMiner is a highly accurate, explainable, and robust classifier that (1) allows us to validate 301 new exoplanets from the MAST Kepler Archive and (2) is general enough to be applied across missions such as the ongoing TESS mission. We perform an extensive experimental study to verify that ExoMiner is more reliable and accurate than the existing transit signal classifiers in terms of different classification and ranking metrics. For example, for a fixed precision value of 99\%, ExoMiner retrieves 93.6\% of all exoplanets in the test set (i.e., recall = 0.936), while this rate is 76.3\% for the best existing classifier. Furthermore, the modular design of ExoMiner favors its explainability. We introduce a simple explainability framework that provides experts with feedback on why ExoMiner classifies a transit signal into a specific class label (e.g., planet candidate or not planet candidate).},

This provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into their interior compositions through atmospheric observations. A key process in doing such work is the vapor outgassing from the lava surface. LavAtmos is an open-source code that calculates the equilibrium chemical composition of vapor above a melt for a given composition and temperature. Results show that the produced output is in good agreement with the partial pressures obtained from experimental laboratory data as well as with other similar codes from literature. LavAtmos allows for the modeling of vaporisation of a wide range of different mantle compositions of hot-rocky exoplanets. In combination with atmospheric chemistry codes, this enables the characterization of interior compositions through atmospheric signatures.},

Such a valley has been observed recently, owing to an improvement in the precision of stellar and therefore planetary radii. Here, we investigate the presence, location, and shape of such a valley using a small samplewith highly accurate stellar parameters determined from asteroseismology,which includes 117 planets with a median uncertainty on the radius of 3.3 per cent.We detect a clear bimodal distribution, with super-Earths ({$\approx$}1.5R{$\oplus$}) and sub-Neptunes ({$\approx$}2.5R{$\oplus$}) separated by a deficiency around 2R{$\oplus$}. We furthermore characterize the slope of the valley as a power law R{$\alpha$}P{$\gamma$} with {$\gamma$} = -0.09+0.02 -0.04. A negative slope is consistent with models of photoevaporation, but not with the late formation of rocky planets in a gas-poor environment, which would lead to a slope of opposite sign. The exact location of the gap further points to planet cores consisting of a significant fraction of rocky material.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) Surveys of protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) have provided important information on their demographics, but due to their sample sizes, they cannot be used to study how disk properties vary with the environment. We conduct a survey of the unresolved millimeter continuum emission of 873 protoplanetary disks identified by Spitzer in the L1641 and L1647 regions of the Orion A cloud. This is the largest such survey yet, allowing us to identify even weak trends in the median disk mass as a function of position in the cloud and cluster membership. The sample detection rates and median masses are also compared to those of nearby ({$<$}300 pc) SFRs. The sample was observed with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 0.08 mJy/beam (1.5 M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$). The data were reduced and imaged using an innovative parallel data processing approach. We detect 58\% (502/873) of the observed disks. This includes 20 disks with dust masses {$>$}100 M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$, and two objects associated with extended dust emission. We infer a median disk dust mass in the full sample of \$2.2\^\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$. In L1641 and L1647 median dust masses are \$2.1\^\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ and \$2.6\^\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.5\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$, respectively. The disk mass distribution of the full sample is similar to that of nearby low-mass SFRs at similar ages of 1-3 Myr. We find only weak trends in disk (dust) masses with galactic longitude and between the YSO clusters identified in the sample, with median masses varying by \$\textbackslash lesssim\$ 50\%. Age differences may explain these median disk mass variations. Apart from this, disk masses are essentially constant at scales of \textasciitilde 100 pc. This also suggests that the majority of disks, even in different SFRs, are formed with similar initial masses and evolve at similar rates, assuming no external irradiation, with disk mass loss rates of \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-8\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$/yr.},

This capability might allow PLATO to detect changes in planetary system architecture with time, particularly because planetary scattering due to Lagrange instability may be triggered long after the system was formed. Here, we utilize previously published instability time-scale prescriptions to determine PLATO's capability to detect a trend of decreasing planet frequency with age for systems with equal- mass planets. For two-planet systems, our results demonstrate that PLATO may detect a trend for planet masses which are at least as massive as super-Earths. For systems with three or more planets, we link their initial compactness to potentially detectable frequency trends in order to aid future investigations when these populations will be better characterized.},

  abstract = {In the search for life beyond our Solar system, attention should be focused on those planets that have the potential to maintain habitable conditions over the prolonged periods of time needed for the emergence and expansion of life as we know it. The observable planetary architecture is one of the determinants for long-term habitability as it controls the orbital evolution and ultimately the stellar fluxes received by the planet. With an ensemble of n-body simulations and obliquity models of hypothetical planetary systems, we demonstrate that the amplitude and period of eccentricity, obliquity, and precession cycles of an Earth-like planet are sensitive to the orbital characteristics of a giant companion planet. A series of transient, ocean-coupled climate simulations show how these characteristics of astronomical cycles are decisive for the evolving surface conditions and long-term fractional habitability relative to the modern Earth. The habitability of Earth-like planets increases with the eccentricity of a Jupiter-like companion, provided that the mean obliquity is sufficiently low to maintain temperate temperatures over large parts of its surface throughout the orbital year. A giant companion closer in results in shorter eccentricity cycles of an Earth-like planet but longer, high-amplitude, obliquity cycles. The period and amplitude of obliquity cycles can be estimated to first order from the orbital pathways calculated by the n-body simulations. In the majority of simulations, obliquity amplitude relates directly to the orbital inclination whereas the period of obliquity cycles is a function of nodal precession and the proximity of a giant companion.},

Using transit timing measurements from Kepler, Palomar/WIRC, and TESS, we show that the orbital period of Kepler-1658b appears to be decreasing at a rate \$\textbackslash dot\{P\}=\{131\}\_\{-22\}\^\{+20\}\$ ms yr-1, corresponding to an infall timescale \$P/\textbackslash dot\{P\}\textbackslash approx 2.5\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Myr\}\$ .

We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: (1) the relative mass function and (2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions and the detection limits on lower mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that (1) the companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a functional form of N {$\propto$} M-1.3{$\pm$}0.03, and consequently, (2) many of these systems likely host additional undetected substellar companions. Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets.},

The model assumes that the atmosphere is ``tightly bound'' by the gravitational field at lower altitudes, that diffusion through the lower atmosphere does not limit the flux, and that the main source of heating is solar euv. Rather low thermospheric temperatures are typical of such escape and a characteristic minimum develops in the temperature profile as the escape flux approaches its maximum possible value. The flux is limited by the amount of euv energy absorbed, which is in turn controlled by the radial extent of the thermosphere. Regardless of the amount of hydrogen in the thermosphere, the low temperatures accompanying rapid escape limit its extent, and thus constrain the flux. Applied to the Earth and Venus, the results suggest that the escape of hydrogen from these planets would have been energy-limited if their primordial atmospheres contained total hydrogen mixing ratios exceeding a few percent. Hydrogen and deuterium may have been lost in bulk, but heavier elements would have remained in the atmosphere. These results place constraints on hypotheses for the origin of the planets and their subsequent evolution.},

The distributions of stellar properties \$M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$, [Fe/H], and \$v\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{sin\}i\$ for the Kepler sub Neptune-sized singles and multis are statistically indistinguishable. (2.) The radius distributions of the sub-Neptune sized singles and multis with \$P \textbackslash textgreater 3\$ days are indistinguishable, and both have a valley at \$\textbackslash backslashsim1.8{$\sim$}R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. However, there are significantly more detected short-period (\$P \textbackslash textless 3\$ days), sub-Neptune sized singles than multis. The similarity of the host star properties, planet radii, and radius valley for singles and multis suggests a common origin. The similar radius valley, which is likely sculpted by photo-evaporation from the host star within the first 100 Myr, suggests that planets in both singles and multis spend much of the first 100 Myr near their present, close-in locations. One explanation that is consistent with the similar fundamental properties of singles and multis is that many of the singles are members of multi-planet systems that underwent planet-planet scattering.},

  abstract = {One of the most important developments in exoplanet science in the past decade is the discovery of multi-planet systems with sub-Neptune-sized planets interior to 1\textasciitilde AU. This chapter explores the architectures of these planetary systems, which often display a remarkable degree of uniformity: the planets have nearly equal sizes, regular orbital spacing, low eccentricities, and small mutual inclinations. This uniformity stands in sharp contrast to the diverse nature of the exoplanet sample considered as a whole (as well as our inner solar system). We begin with a critical review of the observations -- including possible biases -- and find that these peas-in-a-pod planetary systems are apparently a common outcome of the planet formation process. Modest departures from exact uniformity suggest additional patterns, such as the planet mass slowly increasing with semi-major axis. The star formation process naturally produces circumstellar disks with the properties required to produce these planetary systems, although the solid material must move inward from its initial location. We discuss primary modes of planetary assembly, the role of orbital migration, and post-nebular atmospheric loss. Mature planetary systems are found to be near their minimum energy (tidal equilibrium) configurations; this finding provides a partial explanation for their observed properties and indicates that efficient energy dissipation must occur. Finally, we consider population synthesis models and show that peas-in-a-pod patterns emerge with reasonable choices for the input parameters. Nonetheless, interesting observational and theoretical challenges remain in order to understand how these surprisingly organized planetary systems arise from the disorder of their formation processes.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Large sub-Neptunes are uncommon around the coolest stars in the Galaxy and are rarer still around those that are metal-poor. However, owing to the large planet-to-star radius ratio, these planets are highly suitable for atmospheric study via transmission spectroscopy in the infrared, such as with JWST.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here we report the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune orbiting the thick-disk, mid-M dwarf star TOI-2406. The star's low metallicity and the relatively large size and short period of the planet make TOI-2406 b an unusual outcome of planet formation, and its characterisation provides an important observational constraint for formation models.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We first infer properties of the host star by analysing the star's near-infrared spectrum, spectral energy distribution, and \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} parallax. We use multi-band photometry to confirm that the transit event is on-target and achromatic, and we statistically validate the TESS signal as a transiting exoplanet. We then determine physical properties of the planet through global transit modelling of the TESS and ground-based time-series data.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We determine the host to be a metal-poor M4 V star, located at a distance of 56 pc, with properties \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3100 {$\pm$} 75 K, \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{*{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.162 {$\pm$} 0.008\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{*{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.202 {$\pm$} 0.011\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, and [Fe/H] = -0.38 {$\pm$} 0.07, and a member of the thick disk. The planet is a relatively large sub-Neptune for the M-dwarf planet population, with \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{p{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} = 2.94 {$\pm$} 0.17\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{P{$<$}i/{$>$}= 3.077 d, producing transits of 2\% depth. We note the orbit has a non-zero eccentricity to 3\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}, prompting questions about the dynamical history of the system.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} This system is an interesting outcome of planet formation and presents a benchmark for large-planet formation around metal-poor, low-mass stars. The system warrants further study, in particular radial velocity follow-up to determine the planet mass and constrain possible bound companions. Furthermore, TOI-2406 b is a good target for future atmospheric study through transmission spectroscopy. Although the planet's mass remains to be constrained, we estimate the S/N using amass-radius relationship, ranking the system fifth in the population of large sub-Neptunes, with TOI-2406 b having a much lower equilibrium temperature than other spectroscopically accessible members of this population.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii {$<$}4 , paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of these sub-Neptunes and super-Earths. Planetary masses are an important physical property for these studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates in this Earth-to-Neptune size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous works have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and mass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then an intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here we present the first probabilistic mass\textendash radius relationship (M\textendash R relation) evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic dispersion and the uncertainties on the M\textendash R relation parameters. We analyze how the results depend on the radius range of the sample, and on how the masses were measured. Assuming that the M\textendash R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that , a scatter in mass of , and a mass constraint to physically plausible densities, is the ``best-fit'' probabilistic M\textendash R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes (Rpl {$<$} 4 ). More broadly, this work provides a framework for further analyses of the M\textendash R relation and its probable dependencies on period and stellar properties.},

  abstract = {The oxidation of rocky planet surfaces and atmospheres, which arises from the twin forces of stellar nucleosynthesis and gravitational differentiation, is a universal process of key importance to habitability and exoplanet biosignature detection. Here we take a generalized approach to this phenomenon. Using a single parameter to describe the redox state, we model the evolution of terrestrial planets around nearby M stars and the Sun. Our model includes atmospheric photochemistry, diffusion and escape, line-by-line climate calculations, and interior thermodynamics and chemistry. In most cases, we find abiotic atmospheric buildup around M stars during the pre-main-sequence phase to be much less than calculated previously, because the planet's magma ocean absorbs most oxygen liberated from photolysis. However, loss of noncondensing atmospheric gases after the mantle solidifies remains a significant potential route to abiotic atmospheric subsequently. In all cases, we predict that exoplanets that receive lower stellar fluxes, such as LHS1140b and TRAPPIST-1f and g, have the lowest probability of abiotic buildup and hence may be the most interesting targets for future searches for biogenic . Key remaining uncertainties can be minimized in future by comparing our predictions for the atmospheres of hot, sterile exoplanets such as GJ1132b and TRAPPIST-1b and c with observations.},

Several ideas for making the Martian surface more habitable have been put forward5\textendash 8, but they all involve massive environmental modification that will be well beyond human capability for the foreseeable future9. Here, we present a new approach to this problem. We show that widespread regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue to Earth's atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we demonstrate via experiments and modelling that under Martian environmental conditions, a 2\textendash 3\,cm-thick layer of silica aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation and raise temperatures underneath it permanently to above the melting point of water, without the need for any internal heat source. Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the Martian surface could therefore allow photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention. This regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global atmospheric modification. In addition, it can be developed systematically, starting from minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme environments on Earth today.},

Thanks to a wealth of recent planet discoveries and upcoming advances in observing capability, we are poised to characterize the atmospheres of dozens of rocky exoplanets in this decade. The theoretical understanding of rocky exoplanet atmospheres has advanced considerably in the last few years, yielding testable predictions of their evolution, chemistry, dynamics, and even possible biosignatures. We review key progress in this field to date and discuss future objectives. Our major conclusions are as follows: {$\blacksquare$} Many rocky planets may form with initial H2\textendash He envelopes that are later lost to space, likely due to a combination of stellar UV/X-ray irradiation and internal heating. {$\blacksquare$} After the early stages of evolution, a wide diversity of atmospheric compositions is expected as a result of variations in host star flux, atmospheric escape rates, interior exchange, and other factors. {$\blacksquare$} Observations have ruled out both the presence of H2-dominated atmospheres on several nearby rocky exoplanets and the presence of any thick atmosphere on one target. A more detailed atmospheric characterization of these planets and others will become possible in the near future. {$\blacksquare$} Exoplanet biosphere searches are an exciting future goal. However, reliable detections for a representative sample of planets will require further advances in observing capability and improvements in our understanding of abiotic planetary processes.},

Adsorption/desorption cycles utilizing a packed bed of a sorbent material made of diamine-functionalized commercial silica gel are performed under equilibrium and non-equilibrium (short-cycle) conditions. Thereby, the CO2 capture capacity of the material is determined over a wide range of operational parameters, namely 10\textendash 150 mbarabs desorption pressure, 74\textendash 90 \textdegree C desorption temperature, and 0\textendash 80\% relative humidity during adsorption. Up to 158 ml of CO2 (6.8 ml per gram sorbent) with a purity of up to 97.6\% is recovered per cycle. Adsorption isotherms of the sorbent material are experimentally determined by thermogravimetry and fitted to isotherm models, which are successfully applied to predict desorption capacities achieved in the TVS process. Under dry conditions, desorption pressures above 100 mbarabs lead to strongly decreasing CO2 capture capacities below 0.03 mmol g-1. Under humid conditions with 40\% relative humidity during adsorption, the desorption pressure can be raised to 150 mbarabs with capture capacities remaining above 0.2 mmol g-1. Stable performance of the sorbent material in the TVS process is demonstrated over 40 consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles.},

Exoplanets with reported masses and radii are shown to crowd against the extrapolation of the solar system trend, making a metaphorical cosmic shoreline that unites all the planets. The relation may implicate thermal escape. We therefore address the general behavior of hydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly irradiated extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test because copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence requires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences () using proxies and power laws. An energy-limited shoreline should scale as , which differs distinctly from the apparent relation. Energy-limited escape does provide good quantitative agreement to the highly irradiated EGPs. Diffusion-limited escape implies that no planet can lose more than 1\% of its mass as H2. Impact erosion, to the extent that impact velocities can be estimated for exoplanets, fits a shoreline. The proportionality constant is consistent with what the collision of comet Shoemaker\textendash Levy 9 showed us we should expect of modest impacts in deep atmospheres. With respect to the shoreline, Proxima Centauri b is on the metaphorical beach. Known hazards include its rapid energetic accretion, high impact velocities, its early life on the wrong side of the runaway greenhouse, and Proxima Centauri's XUV radiation. In its favor is a vast phase space of unknown unknowns.},

  abstract = {It is often assumed that the "Kepler dichotomy" -- the apparent excess of planetary systems with a single detected transiting planet in the Kepler catalog -- reflects an intrinsic bimodality in the mutual inclinations of planetary orbits. After conducting 600 simulations of planet formation followed by simulated Kepler observations, we instead propose that the apparent dichotomy reflects a divergence in the amount of migration and the separation of planetary semimajor axes into distinct "clusters". We find that our simulated high-mass systems migrate rapidly, bringing more planets into orbital periods of less than 200 days. The outer planets are often caught in a migration trap -- a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant co-rotation torque prevents inward migration -- which splits the system into two clusters. If clusters are sufficiently separated, the inner cluster remains dynamically cold, leading to low mutual inclinations and a higher probability of detecting multiple transiting planets. Conversely, our simulated low-mass systems typically bring fewer planets inside 200 days, forming a single cluster that quickly becomes dynamically unstable, leading to collisions and high mutual inclinations. We propose an alternative explanation for the apparent Kepler dichotomy in which migration traps during formation lead to fewer planets inside the Kepler detection window, and where mutual inclinations play only a secondary role. If our scenario is correct, then Kepler's STIPs (Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets) are a sample of planets that escaped capture by co-rotation traps, and their sizes may be a valuable probe into the structure of protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {Context. Teegarden's Star is the brightest and one of the nearest ultra-cool dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. For its late spectral type (M7.0 V), the star shows relatively little activity and is a prime target for near-infrared radial velocity surveys such as CARMENES. Aims. As part of the CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs, we obtained more than 200 radial-velocity measurements of Teegarden's Star and analysed them for planetary signals. Methods. We find periodic variability in the radial velocities of Teegarden's Star. We also studied photometric measurements to rule out stellar brightness variations mimicking planetary signals. Results. We find evidence for two planet candidates, each with 1.1 M {$\oplus$} minimum mass, orbiting at periods of 4.91 and 11.4 d, respectively. No evidence for planetary transits could be found in archival and follow-up photometry. Small photometric variability is suggestive of slow rotation and old age. Conclusions. The two planets are among the lowest-mass planets discovered so far, and they are the first Earth-mass planets around an ultra-cool dwarf for which the masses have been determined using radial velocities.},

  abstract = {Several small dense exoplanets are now known, inviting comparisons to Earth and Venus. Such comparisons require translating their masses and sizes to composition models of evolved multi-layer interior planets. Such theoretical models rely on our understanding of the Earth's interior, as well as independently derived equations of state, but so far have not involved direct extrapolations from Earth's seismic model: the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). To facilitate more detailed compositional comparisons between small exoplanets and the Earth, we derive here a semi-empirical mass\textendash radius relation for two-layer rocky planets based on PREM, , where CMF stands for core mass fraction. It is applicable to 1 {$\sim$} 8 M{$\oplus$} and a CMF of 0.0 {$\sim$} 0.4. Applying this formula to Earth and Venus and several known small exoplanets with radii and masses measured to better than {$\sim$}30\% precision gives a CMF fit of 0.26 {$\pm$} 0.07.},

  abstract = {The radii and orbital periods of 4,000+ confirmed/candidate exoplanets have been precisely measured by the Kepler mission. The radii show a bimodal distribution, with two peaks corresponding to smaller planets (likely rocky) and larger intermediate-size planets, respectively. While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H2\textendash He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H2O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in the mass range of 10\textendash 15 M, if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have radii of 2.5 R, which exactly match the second peak of the exoplanet radius bimodal distribution. Any planet in the 2-to 4-R range requires a gas envelope of at most a few mass percentage points, regardless of the core composition. To resolve the ambiguity of internal compositions, we use a growth model and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that many intermediate-size planets are ``water worlds''.},

  abstract = {The advent of the laser-frequency comb as the wavelength calibration unit allows us to measure the radial velocity (RV) at cm\,s-1 precision level with high stability in the long term, which enables the possibility of the detection of Earth twins around solar-like stars. A recent study shows that the laser-frequency comb can also be used to measure and study the precision of the instrumental system including the variations of line profile and the systematic uncertainty and instrumental drift. In this paper, we present the stringent analysis of a laser-frequency comb (LFC) system with 25\,GHz repetition frequency on an R {$\sim$} 50\,000 spectrograph with the wavelength spanning from 5085\textendash 7380 \AA. We report a novel fitting model optimized for the comb line profile, the constrained double Gaussian. The constraint condition is set as \$\textbackslash left|\textbackslash mu \_\{1,2\} - \textbackslash mu \textbackslash right| \textbackslash lt \textbackslash sqrt\{2\textbackslash ln2\}\textbackslash sigma\$. We introduce a Bayesian information criterion to test various models. Compared to the traditional Gaussian model, the CDG (constrained double Gaussian) model provides a much better goodness of fit. We apply the CDG model to the observed comb data to demonstrate the improvement of the RV precision with the CDG model. We find that the improvement of the CDG model is about 40\textendash 60~per\,cent for wavelength calibration precision. We also consider the use of the LFC and CDG model as a tool to characterize the line-shape variation across the detector. The aim of this work is to measure and understand the details of the comb lines including their asymmetry and behaviours under various conditions, which play a significant role in the simultaneous calibration process and cross-correlation function method to determine the Doppler shift at high precision level.},

We find that cold Jupiters appear three times more often around hosts of super Earths than they do around field stars. Given the prevalence of the super Earth systems, their cold Jupiters can account for nearly all cold Jupiters. In other words, cold Jupiters are almost certainly (\$\textbackslash backslashsim90\textbackslash backslash\%\$) companied by super Earths. A few corollaries follow: (1) around metal-rich ([Fe/H]\$\textbackslash textgreater0.1\$) stars, the fraction of super Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to \$60\textbackslash backslash\%\$ or higher; (2) the inner architecture can be strongly impacted by the outer giant and we report some observational evidence for this; (3) planetary systems like our own, with cold Jupiters but no super Earths, should be rare (\$\textbackslash backslashsim1\textbackslash backslash\%\$). The strong correlation between super Earths and cold Jupiters establish that super Earths and cold Jupiters do not compete for solid material, rather, they share similar origins, with the cold Jupiter formation requiring a somewhat more stringent condition. Lastly, we propose a few immediate observational tests of our results, using ground-based RV observations and ongoing/planned space missions.},

  abstract = {Lava worlds belong to a class of short orbital period planets reaching dayside temperatures high enough to melt their silicate crust. Theory predicts that the resulting lava oceans outgas their volatile components, attaining equilibrium with the overlying vapour. This creates a tenuous, silicate-rich atmosphere that may be confined to the permanent dayside of the planet. The launch of JWST will provide the much needed sensitivity and spectral coverage to characterise these worlds. In this paper, we assess the observability of characterisable spectral features by self-consistently modelling silicate atmospheres for all the currently confirmed targets having sufficient substellar temperatures ({$>$} 1500 K). To achieve this we use outgassed equilibrium chemistry and radiative transfer methods to compute temperature-pressure profiles, atmospheric chemical compositions and emission spectra. We explore varying melt compositions, free of highly-volatile elements, accounting for possible atmospheric evolution. Our models include a large number of neutral and ionic species, as well as all up-to-date opacities. The results indicate that SiO and SiO2 infrared features are the best, unique identifiers of silicate atmospheres, detectable using MIRI instrument of JWST. Detection of these two species in emission would allow for strong constraints on atmospheric thermal structure and possibly the composition of the melt. We also propose that certain species, e.g., TiO, may be directly tied to different classes of melts, possibly revealing surface and interior dynamics. Currently, there are nearly a dozen confirmed lava planets ideal for characterisation of silicate atmospheres using JWST, with two of these already accepted for the initial General Observers program.},
