For planetary systems subject to all of these effects, analytic solutions (or approximations) are presented for the time evolution of the semimajor axes and eccentricities. Secular interactions enhance the inward migration and accretion of hot Jupiters, while general relativity tends to act in opposition by reducing the effectiveness of the secular perturbations. The analytic solutions presented herein allow us to understand these effects over a wide range of parameter space and to isolate the effects of general relativity in these planetary systems.},

  abstract = {Using the EVEREST photometry pipeline, we have identified 74 candidate ultra-short-period planets (orbital period P\textbackslash textless1 d) in the first half of the K2 data (Campaigns 0-8 and 10). Of these, 33 candidates have not previously been reported. A systematic search for additional transiting planets found 12 new multi-planet systems, double the current number and representing a third (31\%) of USPs. The companions have periods from 1.4 to 31 days (median 5.5 d). Half (50 of 102) of the candidate USPs and companions have been statistically validated or confirmed, 22 for the first time in this work, including 13 USPs. Almost all candidates, and all validated planets, are small (radii Rp\textbackslash textless=3 R\_E) with a median radius of R\_p=1.1 R\_E; the validated and confirmed candidates have radii between 0.4 R\_E and 2.4 R\_E and periods from P=0.18 to 0.96 d. The lack of candidate (a) ultra-hot-Jupiters (R\_p\textbackslash textgreater10) and (b) short-period desert (3\textbackslash textless=Rp\textbackslash textless=10) planets suggests that both populations are rare. These results also provide strong evidence that we have not reached a lower planetary radius limit for planets at close proximity to a star, and suggest that additional improvements in photometry techniques would yield yet more ultra-short-period planets. The large fraction of USPs in known multi-planet systems supports origins models that involve dynamical interactions with exterior planets coupled to tidal decay of the USP orbits.},

  abstract = {This paper constructs a theoretical framework for calculating the distribution of masses for gas giant planets forming via the core accretion paradigm. Starting with known properties of circumstellar disks, we present models for the planetary mass distribution over the range \$0.1M\_J \textbackslash textless M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm p\} \textbackslash textless 10M\_J\$. If the circumstellar disk lifetime is solely responsible for the end of planetary mass accretion, the observed (nearly) exponential distribution of disk lifetime would imprint an exponential fall-off in the planetary mass function. This result is in apparent conflict with observations, which suggest that the mass distribution has a (nearly) power-law form \$dF/dM\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm p\}\textbackslash backslashsim M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm p\}\^\{-p\}\$, with index \$p\textbackslash backslashapprox1.3\$, over the relevant planetary mass range (and for stellar masses \$\textbackslash backslashsim0.5-2M\_\textbackslash backslashodot\$). The mass accretion rate onto the planet depends on the fraction of the (circumstellar) disk accretion flow that enters the Hill sphere, and on the efficiency with which the planet captures the incoming material. Models for the planetary mass function that include distributions for these efficiencies, with uninformed priors, can produce nearly power-law behavior, consistent with current observations. The disk lifetimes, accretion rates, and other input parameters depend on the mass of the host star. We show how these variations lead to different forms for the planetary mass function for different stellar masses. Compared to stars with masses \$M\_\textbackslash backslashast\$ = \$0.5-2M\_\textbackslash backslashodot\$, stars with smaller masses are predicted to have a steeper planetary mass function (fewer large planets).},

An analysis of the TESS photometry, the Minerva-Australis, FEROS, and HARPS radial velocities, and the asteroseismic data of the stellar oscillations reveals that TOI-257b has a mass of \$M\_P=0.134\^\{+0.023\}\_\{-0.022\}\$\$\textbackslash backslashrm\{M\_J\}\$ (\$42.6\^\{+7.3\}\_\{-7.0\}\$\$\textbackslash backslashrm\{M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\}\$), a radius of \$R\_P=0.626\^\{+0.013\}\_\{-0.012\}\$\$\textbackslash backslashrm\{R\_J\}\$ (\$7.02\^\{+0.15\}\_\{-0.13\}\$\$\textbackslash backslashrm\{R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\}\$), and an orbit with eccentricity \$0.242\^\{+0.040\}\_\{-0.065\}\$ and period \$18.38827\textbackslash backslashpm0.00072\$\$\textbackslash backslashrm\{days\}\$.

Planetary structure and formation models assume a common origin of the building blocks, yet, thus far, there is no direct conclusive observational evidence correlating the composition of rocky planets to their host stars. Here we present evidence of a chemical link between rocky planets and their host stars. The iron-mass fraction of the most precisely characterized rocky planets is compared to that of their building blocks, as inferred from the atmospheric composition of their host stars. We find a clear and statistically significant correlation between the two. We also find that this correlation is not one-to-one, owing to the disk-chemistry and planet formation processes. Therefore rocky planet composition depends on the chemical composition of the proto-planetary disk and contains signatures about planet formation processes.},

  abstract = {Revealing the mechanisms shaping the architecture of planetary systems is crucial for our understanding of their formation and evolution. In this context, it has been recently proposed that stellar clustering might be the key in shaping the orbital architecture of exoplanets. The main goal of this work is to explore the factors that shape the orbits of planets. We used a homogeneous sample of relatively young FGK dwarf stars with RV detected planets and tested the hypothesis that their association to phase space (position-velocity) over-densities ('cluster' stars) and under-densities ('field' stars) impacts the orbital periods of planets. When controlling for the host star properties, on a sample of 52 planets orbiting around 'cluster' stars and 15 planets orbiting around 'field' star, we found no significant difference in the period distribution of planets orbiting these two populations of stars. By considering an extended sample of 73 planets orbiting around 'cluster' stars and 25 planets orbiting 'field' stars, a significant different in the planetary period distributions emerged. However, the hosts associated to stellar under-densities appeared to be significantly older than their 'cluster' counterparts. This did not allow us to conclude whether the planetary architecture is related to age, environment, or both. We further studied a sample of planets orbiting 'cluster' stars to study the mechanism responsible for the shaping of orbits of planets in similar environments. We could not identify a parameter that can unambiguously be responsible for the orbital architecture of massive planets, perhaps, indicating the complexity of the issue. Conclusions. Increased number of planets in clusters and in over-density environments will help to build large and unbiased samples which will then allow to better understand the dominant processes shaping the orbits of planets.},

Analysis of a plume of ocean material ejected into space suggests that alkaline hydrothermal vents are present on Enceladus's seafloor. On Earth, such deep-sea vents harbour microbial ecosystems rich in methanogenic archaea. Here we use a Bayesian statistical approach to quantify the probability that methanogenesis (biotic methane production) might explain the escape rates of molecular hydrogen and methane in Enceladus's plume, as measured by Cassini instruments. We find that the observed escape rates (1) cannot be explained solely by the abiotic alteration of the rocky core by serpentinization; (2) are compatible with the hypothesis of habitable conditions for methanogens; and (3) score the highest likelihood under the hypothesis of methanogenesis, assuming that the probability of life emerging is high enough. If the probability of life emerging on Enceladus is low, the Cassini measurements are consistent with habitable yet uninhabited hydrothermal vents and point to unknown sources of methane (for example, primordial methane) awaiting discovery by future missions.},

We conduct a series of numerical simulations to identify dynamically stable regions of the habitable zone of the multiple exoplanet systems capable of hosting an Earth-mass planet. We produce a candidate list of 16 systems that could host such a stable exo-Earth in their habitable zone, and for which the induced radial velocity signal of a hypothetical one, two or four Earth-mass planet on the host star would be detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph. We find that whilst the gravitational interactions with the massive planet nearest the habitable zone are critical in determining stability, the secular resonant interactions between multiple planets can also have a dramatic influence on the overall stability of the habitable zone.},

We next carry out a photodynamical analysis of the Spitzer light curves to derive the density of the host star and the planet densities. We find that all seven planets' densities may be described with a single rocky mass-radius relation which is depleted in iron relative to Earth, with Fe 21 wt\% versus 32 wt\% for Earth, and otherwise Earth-like in composition. Alternatively, the planets may have an Earth-like composition, but enhanced in light elements, such as a surface water layer or a core-free structure with oxidized iron in the mantle. We measure planet masses to a precision of 3-5\%, equivalent to a radial-velocity (RV) precision of 2.5 cm/sec, or two orders of magnitude more precise than current RV capabilities. We find the eccentricities of the planets are very small; the orbits are extremely coplanar; and the system is stable on 10 Myr timescales. We find evidence of infrequent timing outliers which we cannot explain with an eighth planet; we instead account for the outliers using a robust likelihood function. We forecast JWST timing observations, and speculate on possible implications of the planet densities for the formation, migration and evolution of the planet system.},

Although dense protoplanetary environments favor fast dust coagulation, there are several factors that limit the straightforward pathway from interstellar micron-size grains to pebble-size aggregates. Apart from the grain bouncing, fragmentation, and fast drift to the central star, a notable limiting factor is the electrostatic repulsion of like-charged grains. In this study we aim at theoretical modeling of the dust coagulation coupled with the dust charging and disk ionization calculations. We show that the electrostatic barrier is a strong restraining factor to the coagulation of micrometer-size dust in dead zones of the disk (where the turbulence is suppressed). While the sustained turbulence helps to overcome the electrostatic barrier, low fractal dimensions of dust aggregates can potentially block their further coagulation even in this case. Coulomb repulsion may keep a significant fraction of small dust in the disk atmosphere and outer regions.},

Our aim is twofold: firstly, to analyse the relationship between excess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, to investigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of the central object. The accretion luminosity (Lacc), and in turn the accretion rate (\'a\texteuro acc), was derived by modelling the excess emission from the UV to the near-infrared as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. We computed the flux and luminosity (Lline) of many emission lines of H, He, and Ca ii, observed simultaneously in the range from {$\sim$}330 nm to 2500 nm. The luminosity of all the lines is well correlated with Lacc. We provide empirical relationships between Lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which have a lower dispersion than relationships previously reported in the literature. Our measurements extend the Pa{$\beta$} and Br{$\gamma$} relationships to Lacc values about two orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. We confirm that different methodologies of measuring Lacc and \'a\texteuro{} acc yield significantly different results: H{$\alpha$} line profile modelling may underestimate \'a\texteuro acc by 0.6 to 0.8 dex with respect to \'a\texteuro acc derived from continuum-excess measures. These differences may explain the probably spurious bi-modal relationships between \'a\texteuro acc and other YSOs properties reported in the literature. We derived \'a\texteuro acc in the range 2 \texttimes{} 10-12-4 \texttimes{} 10-8 M\^a\v{S}\texttrademark{} yr-1 and conclude that \'a\texteuro acc a\^\^ M\^a\textdagger 1.8({$\pm$}0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than in previous studies. A number of properties indicate that the physical conditions of the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in \'a\texteuro acc, confirming previous suggestions that the geometry of the accretion flow controls the rate at which the disc material accretes onto the central star. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2013.},

Here we present a model that combines equilibrium chemistry in evolving discs with core accretion that tracks materials accreted on to planets during their formation. In doing so, we aim to explain why super Earths form so frequently and how they acquire such a diverse range of compositions. A key feature of our model is disc inhomogeneities, or planet traps, that act as barriers to rapid type-I migration. The traps we include are the dead zone, which can be caused by either cosmic ray or X-ray ionization, the ice line, and the heat transition. We find that in discs with sufficiently long lifetimes ({$\greaterequivlnt$}4 Myr), all traps produce Jovian planets. In these discs, planet formation in the heat transition and X-ray dead zone produces hot Jupiters, while the ice line and cosmic ray dead zones produce Jupiters at roughly 1 au. Super Earth formation takes place within shortlived discs ({$\lessequivlnt$}2 Myr), whereby the discs are photoevaporated while planets are in a slow phase of gas accretion.We find that super Earth compositions range from dry and rocky (\textbackslash textless6 per cent ice by mass) to those with substantial water contents (\textbackslash textgreater30 per cent ice by mass). The traps play a crucial role in our results, as they dictate where in the disc particular planets can accrete from, and what compositions they are able to acquire.},

We perform planet population synthesis calculations based on the initial observed distributions of host star and disc properties - their disc masses, lifetimes, and stellar metallicities. We find the frequency of giant planet formation scales with disc metallicity, in agreement with the observed Jovian planet frequency-metallicity relation. We consider both X-ray and cosmic ray disc ionization models, whose differing ionization rates lead to different dead zone trap locations. In both cases, Jovian planets form in our model out to 2-3 au, with a distribution at smaller radii dependent on the disc ionization source and the setting of envelope opacity. We find that low values of {$\kappa$}env (0.001-0.002 cm2 g-1) and X-ray disc ionization are necessary to obtain a separation between hot Jupiters near 0.1 au, and warm Jupiters outside 0.6 au, a feature present in the data. Our model also produces a large number of super Earths, but the majority are outside of 2 au. As our model assumes a constant dust-to-gas ratio, we suggest that radial dust evolution must be taken into account to reproduce the observed super Earth population.},

  abstract = {Recent ALMA observations indicate that while a range of disc sizes exist, typical disc radii are small, and that radial dust drift affects the distribution of solids in discs. Here, we explore the consequences of these features in planet population synthesis models. A key feature of our model is planet traps - barriers to otherwise rapid type-I migration of forming planets - for which we include the ice line, heat transition, and outer edge of the dead zone. We find that the ice line plays a fundamental role in the formation of warm Jupiters. In particular, the ratio of super Earths to warm Jupiters formed at the ice line depends sensitively on the initial disc radius. Initial gas disc radii of {$\sim$}50 au results in the largest super Earth populations, while both larger and smaller disc sizes result in the ice line producing more gas giants near 1 au. This transition between typical planet class formed at the ice line at various disc radii confirms that planet formation is fundamentally linked to disc properties (in this case, disc size), and is a result that is only seen when dust evolution effects are included in our models. Additionally, we find that including radial dust drift results in the formation of more super Earths between 0.1 and 1 au, having shorter orbital radii than those produced in models where dust evolution effects are not included.},

  abstract = {The exoplanet mass-radius diagram reveals that super-Earths display a wide range of radii, and therefore mean densities, at a given mass. Using planet population synthesis models, we explore the key physical factors that shape this distribution: planets' solid core compositions, and their atmospheric structure. For the former, we use equilibrium disc chemistry models to track accreted minerals on to planetary cores throughout the formation. For the latter, we track gas accretion during the formation and consider photoevaporation-driven atmospheric mass-loss to determine what portion of accreted gas escapes after the disc phase. We find that atmospheric stripping of Neptunes and sub-Saturns at small orbital radii ({$\odot$}0.1 au) plays a key role in the formation of short-period super-Earths. Core compositions are strongly influenced by the trap in which they formed. We also find a separation between Earth-like planet compositions at small orbital radii {$\odot$}0.5 au and ice-rich planets (up to 50 per cent by mass) at larger orbits 1 au. This corresponds well with the Earth-like mean densities inferred from the observed position of the low-mass planet radius valley at small orbital periods. Our model produces planet radii comparable to observations at masses 1-3 M{$\odot$}. At larger masses, planets' accreted gas significantly increases their radii to be larger than most of the observed data. While photoevaporation, affecting planets at small orbital radii {$\odot$}0.1 au, reduces a subset of these planets' radii and improves our comparison, most planets in our computed populations are unaffected due to low-far ultraviolet fluxes as they form at larger separations.},

We present a critical review of current theoretical models, and discuss the observations that are used to test these models and inform our understanding of the underlying physics. We also discuss the role disk dispersal plays in shaping planetary systems, considering its influence on both the process(es) of planet formation and the architectures of planetary systems.

  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy is a promising tool for the atmospheric characterization of transiting exoplanets. Because the planetary signal is faint, discrepancies have been reported regarding individual targets. We investigate the dependence of the estimated transmission spectrum on deviations of the orbital parameters of the star-planet system that are due to the limb-darkening effects of the host star. We describe how the uncertainty on the orbital parameters translates into an uncertainty on the planetary spectral slope. We created synthetic transit light curves in seven different wavelength bands, from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and fit them with transit models parameterized by fixed deviating values of the impact parameter \$b\$. Our simulations show a wavelength-dependent offset that is more pronounced at the blue wavelengths where the limb-darkening effect is stronger. This offset introduces a slope in the planetary transmission spectrum that becomes steeper with increasing \$b\$ values. Variations of \$b\$ by positive or negative values within its uncertainty interval introduce positive or negative slopes, thus the formation of an error envelope. The amplitude from blue optical to near-infrared wavelength for a typical uncertainty on \$b\$ corresponds to one atmospheric pressure scale height and more. This impact parameter degeneracy is confirmed for different host types; K stars present prominently steeper slopes, while M stars indicate features at the blue wavelengths. We demonstrate that transmission spectra can be hard to interpret, basically because of the limitations in defining a precise impact parameter value for a transiting exoplanet. This consequently limits a characterization of its atmosphere.},

Starting with a core of a fraction of an Earth's mass located at 8 AU, we end our simulation with the onset of runaway gas accretion when the planet is at 5.5 AU 1 Myr later. This timescale is about a factor ten shorter than the one found by Pollack et al. (1996) even though the disc was less massive initially and viscously evolving. Other initial conditions can lead to even shorter timescales. The reason for this speed-up is found to result from the fact that a moving planet does not deplete its feeding zone to the extend of a static planet. Thus, the uncomfortably long formation timescale associated with the core-accretion scenario can be considerably reduced and brought in much better agreement with the typical disc lifetimes inferred from observations of young circumstellar discs.},

  abstract = {Context. Planet formation models have been developed during the past years to try to reproduce what has been observed of both thesolar system and the extrasolar planets. Some of these models have partially succeeded, but they focus on massive planets and, for the sake of simplicity, exclude planets belonging to planetary systems.However, more and more planets are now found in planetary systems. This tendency, which is a result of radial velocity, transit, and direct imaging surveys, seems to be even more pronounced for low-mass planets. These new observations require improving planet formation models, including new physics, and considering the formation of systems. Aims. In a recent series of papers, we have presented some improvements in the physics of our models, focussing in particular on the internal structure of forming planets, and on the computation of the excitation state of planetesimals and their resulting accretion rate. In this paper, we focus on the concurrent effect of the formation of more than one planet in the same protoplanetary disc and show the effect, in terms of architecture and composition of this multiplicity. Methods. We used an N-body calculation including collision detection to compute the orbital evolution of a planetary system. Moreover, we describe the effect of competition for accretion of gas and solids, as well as the effect of gravitational interactions between planets. Results. We show that the masses and semi-major axes of planets are modified by both the effect of competition and gravitational interactions. We also present the effect of the assumed number of forming planets in the same system (a free parameter of the model), as well as the effect of the inclination and eccentricity damping. We find that the fraction of ejected planets increases from nearly 0 to 8\% as we change the number of embryos we seed the system with from 2 to 20 planetary embryos. Moreover, our calculations show that, when considering planets more massive than {$\sim$}5 M\^a\v{S}\textbullet, simulations with 10 or 20 planetary embryos statistically give the same results in terms of mass function and period distribution. \textcopyright{} 2013 ESO.},

Computing the mass of planetary envelopes and the critical mass beyond which planets accrete gas in a runaway fashion is important for studying planet formation, in particular, for planets up to the Neptune-mass range. This computation in principle requires solving a set of differential equations, the internal structure equations, for some boundary conditions (pressure, temperature in the protoplanetary disc where a planet forms, core mass, and the rate of accretion of solids by the planet). Solving these equations in turn proves to be time-consuming and sometimes numerically unstable. Aims. The aim is to provide a way to approximate the result of integrating the internal structure equations for a variety of boundary conditions. Methods. We computed a set of internal planetary structures for a very large number (millions) of boundary conditions, considering two opacities: that of the interstellar medium, and a reduced opacity. This database was then used to train deep neural networks (DNN) in order to predict the critical core mass and the mass of planetary envelopes as a function of the boundary conditions. Results. We show that our neural networks provide a very good approximation (at the percent level) of the result obtained by solving interior structure equations, but the required computer time is much shorter. The difference with the real solution is much smaller than the difference that is obtained with some analytical formulas that are available in the literature, which only provide the correct order of magnitude at best. We compare the results of the DNN with other popular machine-learning methods (random forest, gradient boost, support vector regression) and show that the DNN outperforms these methods by a factor of at least two. Conclusions. We show that some analytical formulas that can be found in various papers can severely overestimate the mass of planets and therefore predict the formation of planets in the Jupiter-mass regime instead of the Neptune-mass regime. The python tools that we provide allow computing the critical mass and the mass of planetary envelopes in a variety of cases, without the requirement of solving the internal structure equations. These tools can easily replace previous analytical formulas and provide far more accurate results.},

  abstract = {Context. Planet formation models are now often considering the formation of planetary systems, with more than one planet per system. This raises the question of how to represent planetary systems in a convenient way, (e.g. for visualisation purpose) and how to define the similarity between two planetary systems, for example to compare models and observations. Aims. We define a new metric to infer the similarity between two planetary systems, based on the properties of planets that belong to these systems. We then compare the similarity of planetary systems with the similarity of protoplanetary discs in which they form. Methods. We first define a new metric based on mixture of gaussians, and then use this metric to apply a dimensionality reduction technique, in order to represent planetary systems (which should be represented in a high dimension space) in a 2 dimension space. This allows us study the structure of a population of planetary systems and its relation with the characteristics of protoplanetary discs in which planetary systems form. Results. We show that the new metric can help finding the underlying structure of populations of planetary systems. In addition, the similarity between planetary systems as we define in this paper is correlated with the similarity between the protoplanetary discs in which these systems form. We finally compare the distribution of inter-system distances for a set of observed exoplanets, with the distributions obtained from two models: a population synthesis model, and a model where planetary systems are constructed by randomly picking synthetic planets. The observed distribution is shown to be closer to the one derived from the population synthesis model than from the random systems. Conclusions. The new metric can be used in a variety of unsupervised machine learning techniques, like dimensionality reduction, clustering, etc., to understand results of simulations and compare them with the properties of observed planetary systems.},

Convolutional neural networks are known to have contributed to improving the accuracy of classification tasks. The network optimization is typically performed without studying the effect of noise on the training process. Here we design and optimize a 1D convolutional neural network to classify photometric transit light curves. We regularize the network by the total variation loss in order to remove unwanted variations in the data features. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of our network, which produces results comparable to or better than the standard network solutions. Most importantly, our network clearly outperforms a classical method used in exoplanet science to identify moon-like signals. Thus the proposed network is a promising approach for analyzing real transit light curves in the future.},

  abstract = {Unveiling the fate of ultra-short period (USP) planets may help us understand the qualitative agreement between tidal theory and the observed exoplanet distribution. Nevertheless, due to the time-varying interchange of spin-orbit angular momentum in star-planet systems, the expected amount of tidal friction is unknown and depends on the dissipative properties of stellar and planetary interiors. In this work, we couple structural changes in the star and the planet resulting from the energy released per tidal cycle and simulate the orbital evolution of USP planets and the spin-up produced on their host star. For the first time, we allow the strength of magnetic braking to vary within a model that includes photo-evaporation, drag caused by the stellar wind, stellar mass loss, and stellar wind enhancement due to the in-falling USP planet. We apply our model to the two exoplanets with the shortest periods known to date, NGTS-10b and WASP-19b. We predict they will undergo orbital decay in time-scales that depend on the evolution of the tidal dissipation reservoir inside the star, as well as the contribution of the stellar convective envelope to the transfer of angular momentum. Contrary to previous work, which predicted mid-transit time shifts of \$\textbackslash backslashsim30-190\$ s over 10 years, we found that such changes would be smaller than 10 s. We note this is sensitive to the assumptions about the dissipative properties of the system. Our results have important implications for the search for observational evidence of orbital decay in USP planets, using present and future observational campaigns.},

  abstract = {Many warm Jupiters (WJs) have substantial eccentricities, which are linked to their formation and migration histories. This paper explores eccentricity excitation of WJs due to planet-planet scattering, beginning with 3-4 planets in unstable orbits, with the innermost planet placed in the range (0.1 - 1)AU. Such a setup is consistent with either in-situ formation or arrival at sub-AU orbits due to disk migration. Most previous N-body experiments have focused on "cold" Jupiters at several AU, where scattering results in planet ejections, efficiently exciting the eccentricities of surviving planets. In contrast, scattering at sub-AU distances results in a mixture of collisions and ejections, and the final eccentricities of surviving planets are unclear. We conduct scattering experiments for a range of planet masses and initial spacings, including the effect of general relativistic apsidal precession, and systematically catalogue the scattering outcomes and properties of surviving planets. A comparable number of one-planet and two-planet systems are produced. Two-planet systems arise exclusively through planet-planet collisions, and tend to have low eccentricities/mutual inclinations and compact configurations. One-planet systems arise through a combination of ejections and collisions, resulting in higher eccentricities. The observed eccentricity distribution of solitary WJs (lacking detection of a giant planet companion) is consistent with roughly 60\% of the systems having undergone in-situ scattering, and the remaining experiencing a quiescent history.},

  abstract = {Context. There is growing evidence that massive stars grow by disk accretion in a similar way to their low-mass counterparts. Early in evolution, these disks can achieve masses that are comparable to the current stellar mass, and therefore the forming disks are highly susceptible to gravitational fragmentation. Aims. We investigate the formation and early evolution of an accretion disk around a forming massive protostar, focussing on its fragmentation physics. To this end, we follow the collapse of a molecular cloud of gas and dust, the formation of a massive protostar, the formation of its circumstellar disk, and the formation and evolution of the disk fragments. Methods. We used a grid-based, self-gravity radiation hydrodynamics code including a sub-grid module for stellar evolution and dust evolution. We purposely do not use a sub-grid module for fragmentation such as sink particles to allow for all paths of fragment formation and destruction, but instead we keep the spatial grid resolution high enough to properly resolve the physical length scales of the problem, namely the pressure scale height and Jeans length of the disk. Simulations are performed on a grid in spherical coordinates with a logarithmic spacing of the grid cells in the radial direction and a cosine distribution of the grid cells in the polar direction, focusing the spatial resolution on the disk midplane. As a consequence, roughly 25\% of the total number of grid cells, corresponding to {$\sim$}26 million grid cells, are used to model the disk physics. These constitute the highest resolution simulations performed up to now on disk fragmentation around a forming massive star with the physics considered here. For a better understanding of the effects of spatial resolution and to compare our high-resolution results with previous lower resolution studies in the literature, we perform the same simulation at five different resolutions, each run differing in resolution from its predecessor by a factor of two. Results. The cloud collapses and a massive (proto)star is formed in its center surrounded by a fragmenting Keplerian-like accretion disk with spiral arms. The fragments have masses of {$\sim$}1 M, and their continuous interactions with the disk, spiral arms, and other fragments result in eccentric orbits. Fragments form hydrostatic cores surrounded by secondary disks with spiral arms that also produce new fragments. We identified several mechanisms of fragment formation, interaction, and destruction. Central temperatures of the fragments can reach the hydrogen dissociation limit, form second Larson cores, and evolve into companion stars. Based on this, we study the multiplicity predicted by the simulations and find approximately six companions at different distances from the primary: from possible spectroscopic multiples, to companions at distances between 1000 and 2000 au.},

The submillimeter detection rate is 61\% to a completeness limit of {$\sim$}10 mJy (3-sigma) at 850 microns. The inferred circumstellar disk masses are log-normally distributed with a mean mass of {$\sim$}0.005 solar masses and a large dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one third of the submillimeter sources have disk masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The median disk to star mass ratio is 0.5\%. The empirical behavior of the submillimeter continuum is best described as F\_nu {$\sim$} nu\^(2.0 +/- 0.5) between 350 microns and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the opacity compared to the ISM. This latter effect could be due to a substantial population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer disk are removed nearly simultaneously.},

Using 2-D radiative transfer calculations, we simultaneously fit the observed continuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk with a parametric structure model. Compared to previous millimeter studies, this survey includes significant upgrades in modeling, data quality, and angular resolution that provide improved constraints on key structure parameters, particularly those that characterize the spatial distribution of mass in the disks. In the context of a surface density profile motivated by similarity solutions for viscous accretion disks, the best-fit models for the sample disks have characteristic radii R\_c = 20-200 AU, high disk masses M\_d = 0.005-0.14 M\_sun, and a narrow range of radial surface density gradients around a median \$\textbackslash backslashgamma\$ = 0.9. These density structures are used in conjunction with accretion rate estimates from the literature to help characterize the viscous evolution of the disk material. Using the standard prescription for disk viscosities, those combined constraints indicate that \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ = 0.0005-0.08. Three of the sample disks show large (R = 20-40 AU) central cavities in their continuum emission morphologies, marking extensive zones where dust has been physically removed and/or has significantly diminished opacities. Based on the current requirements of planet formation models, these emission cavities and the structure constraints for the sample as a whole suggest that these young disks may eventually produce planetary systems, and have perhaps already started.

An expanded sample is constructed to probe disk structures that emit significantly lower millimeter luminosities (hence dust masses), down to the median value for T Tauri stars. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, the millimeter visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk are simultaneously reproduced with a two-dimensional parametric model for a viscous accretion disk that has a surface density profile {$\Sigma$} {$\propto$} (R/Rc) -{$\gamma$} exp [-(R/Rc)2-{$\gamma$}]. We find wide ranges of characteristic radii (Rc = 14-198 AU) and disk masses (Md = 0.004-0.143 M{$\odot$}), but a narrow distribution of surface density gradients ({$\gamma$} = 0.4-1.1) that is consistent with a uniform value ({$\gamma$}) = 0.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 and independent of mass (or millimeter luminosity). In this sample, we find a correlation between the disk luminosity/mass and characteristic radius, such that fainter disks are both smaller and less massive. We suggest that this relationship is an imprint of the initial conditions inherited by the disks at their formation epoch, compare their angular momenta with those of molecular cloud cores, and speculate on how future observations can help constrain the distribution of viscous evolution timescales. No other correlations between disk and star properties are found. The inferred disk structures are briefly compared with theoretical models for giant planet formation, although resolution limitations do not permit us to directly comment on material inside R {$\approx$} 20 AU. However, there is some compelling evidence for the evolution of dust in the planet formation region: 4/17 disks in the sample show resolved regions of significantly reduced millimeter optical depths within {$\sim$}20-40 AU of their central stars. \textcopyright{} 2010.

Combining these new data with measurements in the literature, we construct a mm-wave luminosity distribution, f (Lmm), for Class II disks that is statistically complete for stellar hosts with spectral types earlier than M8.5 and has a 3{$\sigma$} depth of roughly 3 mJy. The resulting census eliminates a longstanding selection bias against disks with late-type hosts, and thereby demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between Lmm and the host spectral type. By translating the locations of individual stars in the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram into masses and ages, and adopting a simple conversion between Lmm and the diskmass,Md, we confirm that this correlation corresponds to a statistically robust relationship between themasses of dust disks and the stars that host them.ABayesian regression technique is used to characterize these relationships in the presence of measurement errors, data censoring, and significant intrinsic scatter: the best-fit results indicate a typical 1.3mmflux density of{$\sim$}25 mJy for 1M? hosts and a power-law scaling Lmm {$\propto$} M1.5-2.0 .We suggest that a reasonable treatment of dust temperature in the conversion {${_\ast}$} from Lmm toMd favors an inherently linearMd {$\propto$} M{${_\ast}$} scaling, with a typical disk-to-star mass ratio of{$\sim$}0.2\%\textendash 0.6\%. The measured rms dispersion around this regression curve is {$\pm$}0.7 dex, suggesting that the combined effects of diverse evolutionary states, dust opacities, and temperatures in these disks imprint a full width at half-maximum range of a factor of{$\sim$}40 on the inferredMd (or Lmm) at any given hostmass.We argue that this relationship between Md andM{${_\ast}$} likely represents the origin of the inferred correlation between giant planet frequency and host starmass in the exoplanet population, and provides some basic support for the core accretion model for planet formation. Moreover, we caution that the effects of incompleteness and selection bias must be considered in comparative studies of disk evolution, and illustrate that fact with statistical comparisons of f (Lmm) between the Taurus catalog presented here and incomplete subsamples in the Ophiuchus, IC 348, and Upper Sco young clusters.},

Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing the following three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: {$\blacksquare$}Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts. {$\blacksquare$}There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate. {$\blacksquare$}Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes-presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima-broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks.The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch.},

  abstract = {We present the first high-resolution sub-mm survey of both dust and gas for a large population of protoplanetary disks. Characterizing fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks on a statistical level is critical to understanding how disks evolve into the diverse exoplanet population. We use ALMA to survey 89 protoplanetary disks around stars with \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashast\}\textbackslash textgreater0.1{$\sim$}M\_\{\textbackslash backslashodot\}\$ in the young (1\textendash 3{$\sim$}Myr), nearby (150\textendash 200{$\sim$}pc) Lupus complex. Our observations cover the 890{$\sim\$\backslash$}backslashmu\$m continuum and the \$\^\{13\}\$CO and C\$\^\{18\}\$O 3\textendash 2 lines. We use the sub-mm continuum to constrain \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm dust\}\$ to a few Martian masses (0.2\textendash 0.4{$\sim\$$}M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$) and the CO isotopologue lines to constrain \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm gas\}\$ to roughly a Jupiter mass (assuming ISM-like \$\textbackslash backslashrm \{[CO]/[H\_2]\}\$ abundance). Of 89 sources, we detect 62 in continuum, 36 in \$\^\{13\}\$CO, and 11 in C\$\^\{18\}\$O at \$\textbackslash textgreater3\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ significance. Stacking individually undetected sources limits their average dust mass to \$\textbackslash backslashlesssim6\$ Lunar masses (0.03{$\sim\$$}M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$), indicating rapid evolution once disk clearing begins. We find a positive correlation between \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm dust\}\$ and \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashast\}\$, and present the first evidence for a positive correlation between \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm gas\}\$ and \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashast\}\$, which may explain the dependence of giant planet frequency on host star mass. The mean dust mass in Lupus is 3\$\textbackslash backslashtimes\$ higher than in Upper Sco, while the dust mass distributions in Lupus and Taurus are statistically indistinguishable. Most detected disks have \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm gas\}\textbackslash backslashlesssim1{$\sim$}M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Jup\}\$ and gas-to-dust ratios \$\textbackslash textless100\$, assuming ISM-like \$\textbackslash backslashrm \{[CO]/[H\_2]\}\$ abundance; unless CO is very depleted, the inferred gas depletion indicates that planet formation is well underway by a few Myr and may explain the unexpected prevalence of super-Earths in the exoplanet population.},

  abstract = {The \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ Orionis cluster is important for studying protoplanetary disk evolution, as its intermediate age (\$\textbackslash backslashsim\$3-5 Myr) is comparable to the median disk lifetime. We use ALMA to conduct a high-sensitivity survey of dust and gas in 92 protoplanetary disks around \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ Orionis members with \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashast\}\textbackslash backslashgtrsim0.1 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashodot\}\$. Our observations cover the 1.33 mm continuum and several CO \$J=2-1\$ lines: out of 92 sources, we detect 37 in the mm continuum and six in \$\^\{12\}\$CO, three in \$\^\{13\}\$CO, and none in C\$\^\{18\}\$O. Using the continuum emission to estimate dust mass, we find only 11 disks with \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm dust\}\textbackslash backslashgtrsim10 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$, indicating that after only a few Myr of evolution most disks lack sufficient dust to form giant planet cores. Stacking the individually undetected continuum sources limits their average dust mass to 5\$\textbackslash backslashtimes\$ lower than that of the faintest detected disk, supporting theoretical models that indicate rapid dissipation once disk clearing begins. Comparing the protoplanetary disk population in \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ Orionis to those of other star-forming regions supports the steady decline in average dust mass and the steepening of the \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm dust\}\$-\$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashast\}\$ relation with age; studying these evolutionary trends can inform the relative importance of different disk processes during key eras of planet formation. External photoevaporation from the central O9 star is influencing disk evolution throughout the region: dust masses clearly decline with decreasing separation from the photoionizing source, and the handful of CO detections exist at projected separations \$\textbackslash textgreater1.5\$ pc. Collectively, our findings indicate that giant planet formation is inherently rare and/or well underway by a few Myr of age.},

The spatial resolution is {$\sim$} 0".25 with a medium 3{$\sigma$} continuum sensitivity of 0.30 mJy, corresponding to Mdust {$\sim$} 0.2 M{$\otimes$}. We apply "Keplerian masking" to enhance the signal- to-noise ratios of our 12CO zero-moment maps, enabling measurements of gas disk radii for 22 Lupus disks; we find that gas disks are universally larger than mm dust disks by a factor of two on average, likely due to a combination of the optically thick gas emission as well as the growth and inward drift of the dust. Using the gas disk radii, we calculate the dimensionless viscosity parameter, ffvisc, finding a broad distribution and no correlations with other disk or stellar parameters, suggesting that viscous processes have not yet established quasi-steady states in Lupus disks. By combining our 1.33 mm continuum fluxes with our previous 890 {$\mu$}m continuum observations, we also calculate the mm spectral index, {$\alpha$}mm, for 70 Lupus disks; we find an anti-correlation between {$\alpha$}mm and mm flux for low-mass disks (Mdust{$\leq$} 5), followed by a attening as disks approach {$\alpha$}mm {$\sim$} 2, which could indicate faster grain growth in higher-mass disks, but may also re ect their larger optically thick components. In sum, this work demonstrates the continuous stream of new insights into disk evolution and planet formation that can be gleaned from unbiased ALMA disk surveys.},

  abstract = {An outstanding, multi-disciplinary goal of modern science is the study of the diversity of potentially Earth-like planets and the search for life in them. This goal requires a bold new generation of space telescopes, but even the most ambitious designs yet hope to characterize several dozen potentially habitable planets. Such a sample may be too small to truly understand the complexity of exo-earths. We describe here a notional concept for a novel space observatory designed to characterize 1,000 transiting exo-earth candidates. The Nautilus concept is based on an array of inflatable spacecraft carrying very large diameter (8.5m), very low-weight, multi-order diffractive optical elements (MODE lenses) as light-collecting elements. The mirrors typical to current space telescopes are replaced by MODE lenses with a 10 times lighter areal density that are 100 times less sensitive to misalignments, enabling light-weight structure. MODE lenses can be cost-effectively replicated through molding. The Nautilus mission concept has a potential to greatly reduce fabrication and launch costs, and mission risks compared to the current space telescope paradigm through replicated components and identical, light-weight unit telescopes. Nautilus is designed to survey transiting exo-earths for biosignatures up to a distance of 300 pc, enabling a rigorous statistical exploration of the frequency and properties of life-bearing planets and the diversity of exo-earths.},

  pages = {1--18},
  abstract = {Recent surveys have revealed that protoplanetary disks typically have dust masses that appear to be insufficient to account for the high occurrence rate of exoplanet systems. We demonstrate that this observed dust depletion is consistent with the radial drift of pebbles. Using a Monte Carlo method we simulate the evolution of a cluster of protoplanetary disks, using a 1D numerical method to viscously evolve each gas disk together with the radial drift of dust particles that have grown to 100 \$\textbackslash backslashmu\$m in size. For a 2 Myr old cluster of stars, we find a slightly sub-linear scaling between the gas disk mass and the gas accretion rate (\$M\_\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{g\}\textbackslash backslashpropto\textbackslash backslashdot\{M\}\^\{0.9\}\$). However, for the dust mass we find that evolved dust disks have a much weaker scaling with the gas accretion rate, with the precise scaling depending on the age at which the cluster is sampled and the intrinsic age spread of the disks in the cluster. Ultimately, we find that the dust mass present in protoplanetary disk is on the order of 10-100 Earth masses in 1-3 Myr old star-forming regions, a factor of 10 to 100 depleted from the original dust budget. As the dust drains from the outer disk, pebbles pile up in the inner disk and locally increase the dust-to-gas ratio by a factor of up to 4 above the initial value. In these high dust-to-gas ratio regions we find conditions that are favourable for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability and subsequent growth by pebble accretion. We also find the following scaling relations with stellar mass within a 1-2 Myr old cluster: a slightly super-linear scaling between the gas accretion rate and stellar mass (\$\textbackslash backslashdot\{M\}\textbackslash backslashpropto M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\^\{1.4\}\$), a slightly super-linear scaling between the gas disk mass and the stellar mass (\$M\_\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{g\}\textbackslash backslashpropto M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\^\{1.4\}\$) and a super-linear relation between the dust disk mass and stellar mass (\$M\_\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{d\}\textbackslash backslashpropto M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\^\{1.4-4.1\}\$).},

The Kepler mission has led to an abundance of statistical discoveries in regards to planetary radius, but the number of observed planets with measured masses is much smaller. By incorporating results from recent mass determination programs, we have discovered a new gap emerging in the planet population for sub-Neptune mass planets with orbital periods less than 20 days. The gap follows a slope of decreasing mass with increasing orbital period, has a width of a few \$M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, and is potentially completely devoid of planets. Fitting gaussian mixture models to the planet population in this region favours a bimodel distribution over a unimodel one with a reduction in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of 19.9, highlighting the gap significance. We discuss several processes which could generate such a feature in the planet distribution, including a pileup of planets above the gap region, tidal interactions with the host star, dynamical interactions with the disk, with other planets, or with accreting material during the formation process.},

  abstract = {The interiors of giant planets remain poorly understood. Even for the planets in the Solar System, difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in the properties of planetary cores. Exoplanets that have undergone rare evolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary interiors. Planets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune `desert'1,2 (a region in mass\textendash radius space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly valuable in this regard. These planets include HD149026b3, which is thought to have an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such as LTT9779b4 and NGTS-4b5, on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their outer atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which has a radius smaller than Neptune's but an anomalously large mass of 39.1-2.6+2.7 Earth masses and a density of 5.2-0.8+0.7 grams per cubic centimetre, similar to Earth's. Interior-structure models suggest that any gaseous envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than 3.9-0.9+0.8 per cent of the total planetary mass. The planet could have been a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss via thermal self-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided substantial gas accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation6. Although photoevaporation rates cannot account for the mass loss required to reduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few Earth masses) hydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying that any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or other volatiles from the planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the remnant core of a giant planet.},

  abstract = {The detection of a wide range of substructures such as rings, cavities and spirals has become a common outcome of high spatial resolution imaging of protoplanetary disks, both in the near-infrared scattered light and in the thermal millimetre continuum emission. The most frequent interpretation of their origin is the presence of planetary-mass companions perturbing the gas and dust distribution in the disk (perturbers), but so far the only bona-fide detection has been the two giant planets around PDS 70. Here, we collect a sample of 15 protoplanetary disks showing substructures in SPHERE scattered light images and present a homogeneous derivation of planet detection limits in these systems. We also estimate the mass of these perturbers through a Hill radius prescription and a comparison to ALMA data. Assuming that one single planet carves each substructure in scattered light, we find that more massive perturbers are needed to create gaps within cavities than rings, and that we might be close to a detection in the cavities of RX J1604, RX J1615, Sz Cha, HD 135344B and HD 34282. We reach typical mass limits in these cavities of 3-10 Mjup. For planets in the gaps between rings, we find that the detection limits of SPHERE are about an order of magnitude away in mass, and that the gaps of PDS 66 and HD 97048 seem to be the most promising structures for planet searches. The proposed presence of massive planets causing spiral features in HD 135344B and HD 36112 are also within SPHERE's reach assuming hot-start models.These results suggest that current detection limits are able to detect hot-start planets in cavities, under the assumption that they are formed by a single perturber located at the centre of the cavity. More realistic planet mass constraints would help to clarify whether this is actually the case, which might point to perturbers not being the only way of creating substructures.},

  abstract = {Context: When a planet becomes massive enough, it gradually carves a partial gap around its orbit in the protoplanetary disk. A pressure maximum can be formed outside the gap where solids that are loosely coupled to the gas, typically in the pebble size range, can be trapped. The minimum planet mass for building such a trap, which is called the pebble isolation mass (PIM), is important for two reasons: it marks the end of planetary growth by pebble accretion, and the trapped dust forms a ring that may be observed with millimetre observations. Aims: We study the effect of disk turbulence on the PIM and find its dependence on the gas turbulent viscosity, aspect ratio, and particles Stokes number. Methods: By means of 2D gas hydrodynamical simulations, we found the minimum planet mass to form a radial pressure maximum beyond the orbit of the planet, which is the necessary condition to trap pebbles. We then carried out 2D gas plus dust hydrodynamical simulations to examine how dust turbulent diffusion impacts particles trapping at the pressure maximum. We finally provide a semi-analytical calculation of the PIM based on comparing the radial drift velocity of solids and the root mean square turbulent velocity fluctuations around the pressure maximum. Results: From our results of gas simulations, we provide an expression for the PIM vs. disk aspect ratio and turbulent viscosity. Our gas plus dust simulations show that the effective PIM can be nearly an order of magnitude larger in high-viscosity disks because turbulence diffuse particles out of the pressure maximum. This is quantified by our semi-analytical calculation, which gives an explicit dependence of the PIM with Stokes number of particles. Conclusions: Disk turbulence can significantly alter the PIM, depending on the level of turbulence in regions of planet formation.},

  abstract = {Context. The most accurate method for modelling planetary migration and hence the formation of resonant systems is using hydrodynamical simulations. Usually, the force (torque) acting on a planet is calculated using the forces from the gas disc and the star, while the gas accelerations are computed using the pressure gradient, the star, and the planet's gravity, ignoring its own gravity. For a non-migrating planet the neglect of the disc gravity results in a consistent torque calculation while for a migrating case it is inconsistent. Aims. We aim to study how much this inconsistent torque calculation can affect the final configuration of a two-planet system. We focus on low-mass planets because most of the multi-planetary systems, discovered by the Kepler survey, have masses around ten Earth masses. Methods. Performing hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disc interaction, we measured the torques on non-migrating and migrating planets for various disc masses as well as density and temperature slopes with and without considering the self-gravity of the disc. Using this data, we found a relation that quantifies the inconsistency, used this relation in an N-body code, and performed an extended parameter study modelling the migration of a planetary system with different planet mass ratios and disc surface densities, to investigate the impact of the torque inconsistency on the architecture of the planetary system. Results. Not considering disc self-gravity produces an artificially larger torque on the migrating planet that can result in tighter planetary systems. The deviation of this torque from the correct value is larger in discs with steeper surface density profiles. Conclusions. In hydrodynamical modelling of multi-planetary systems, it is crucial to account for the torque correction, otherwise the results favour more packed systems. We examine two simple correction methods existing in the literature and show that they properly correct this problem.},

  abstract = {Context. The orbital distribution of exoplanets indicates an accumulation of super-Earth sized planets close to their host stars in compact systems. When an inward disc-driven migration scenario is assumed for their formation, these planets could have been stopped and might have been parked at an inner edge of the disc, or be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a resonant chain. This topic has not been properly and extensively studied. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the possibility that the inner planets in a resonant chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by outer planets. We performed hydrodynamical and N-body simulations of planetary systems embedded in their nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc was represented in two different ways, resembling either a dead zone inner edge (DZ) or a disc inner boundary (IB). The main difference lies in the steepness of the surface density profile. The innermost planet always has a mass of 10 M Earth , with additional outer planets of equal or higher mass. A steeper profile is able to stop a chain of planets more efficiently than a shallower profile. The final configurations in our DZ models are usually tighter than in their IB counterparts, and therefore more prone to instability. We derive analytical expressions for the stopping conditions based on power equilibrium, and show that the final eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For planets in thinner discs, we found, for the first time, clear signs for over-stable librations in the hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact systems. We also found that the popular N-body simulations may overestimate the number of planets in the disc inner cavity.},

  title = {Lucky Planets: How Circum-Binary Planets Survive the Supernova in One of the Inner-Binary Components},
  author = {Auer, Fedde Fagginger and Zwart, Simon Portegies},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Since the discovery of exoplanets around pulsars, there has been a debate on their origin. Popular scenarios include in situ formation or the dynamical capture of a planet in a dense stellar system. The possibility of a planet surviving its host star's supernova is often neglected, because a planet in orbit around a single exploding star is not expected to survive the supernova. A circum-binary planet, however, may stand a chance in staying bound when one of the binary components explodes. We investigate the latter and constrain the distribution of post-supernova orbital parameters of circum-binary planets. This is done by performing population synthesis calculations of binary stars until the first supernova. Just before the supernova, we add a planet in orbit around the binary to study its survivability. In our supernova model, the exploding star's mass is assumed to change instantaneously, and we apply a velocity kick to the newly formed remnant. The mass loss and velocity kick affect the orbits of the two stars and the planet. Only \$2 \textbackslash backslashcdot 10\^\{-3\}\$ of systems survive the supernova while keeping the circum-binary planet bound. The surviving planetary orbits are wide (\$a \textbackslash backslashapgt 10\$ au) and eccentric (\$e \textbackslash backslashapgt 0.3\$). It turns out much more likely (\$3\textbackslash backslashcdot 10\^\{-2\}\$ system fraction) that the newly formed compact object is ejected from the system, leaving the planet bound to its companion star in a highly eccentric orbit (typically \$\textbackslash backslashapgt 0.9\$). We expect that the Milky way Galaxy hosts at most \$10\$ x-ray binaries that are still orbited by a planet, and \$\textbackslash backslashaplt 150\$ planets that survived in orbit around the compact object's companion. These numbers should be convolved with the fraction of massive binaries that is orbited by a planet.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Due to the gas rich environments of early circumstellar disks, the gravitational collapse of cool, dense regions of the disk form fragments largely composed of gas. During formation, disk fragments may attain increased metallicities as they interact with the surrounding disk material, whether through particle migration to pressure maxima or through mutual gravitational interaction. In this paper, we investigate the ability of fragments to collect and retain a significant solid component through gas-particle interactions in high-resolution 3D self-gravitating shearing box simulations. The formation of axissymmetric perturbations associated with gravitational instabilities allows particles of intermediate sizes to concentrate through aerodynamic drag forces. By the onset of fragmentation, the mass of local particle concentrations within the fragment are comparable to that of the gas component and the sebsequent gravitational collapse results in the formation of a solid core. We find that these cores can be up to several tens of Earth masses, depending on grain size, before the fragment center reaches temperatures which would sublimate solids. The solid fraction and total mass of the fragment also depend on the metallicity of the young parent protoplanetary disk, with higher initial metallicities resulting in larger fragments and larger solid cores. Additionally, the extended atmospheres of these soon-to-be gas giants or brown dwarfs are occasionally enriched above the initial metallicity, provided no solid core forms in the center and are otherwise lacking in heavier elements when a core does form.},

  abstract = {The exploration of interstellar space will require autonomous navigation systems that do not rely on tracking from the Earth. Here I develop a method to determine the 3D position and 3D velocity of a spacecraft in deep space using a star catalogue. As a spacecraft moves away from the Sun, the observed positions and velocities of the stars will change relative to those in a Earth-based catalogue due to parallax, aberration, and the Doppler effect. By measuring just the angular distances between pairs of stars, and comparing these to the catalogue, we can infer the coordinates of the spacecraft via an iterative forward-modelling process. I perform simulations with existing star catalogues to demonstrate the method and to compute its performance. Using 20 stars and a modest angular distance measurement accuracy of 1", the position and velocity of the spacecraft can be determined to within 3 au and 2 km/s respectively. If a measurement accuracy of 1 mas is achievable then the navigation accuracy increases by a factor of 1000. Using more stars and/or including also onboard measurements of the stars' radial velocities improves the accuracy further.},

  abstract = {We study the formation of the protoplanetary disk by the collapse of a primordial molecular cloud, and how its evolution leads to the selection of specific types of planets. We use a hydrodynamical code that accounts for the dynamics, thermodynamics, geometry, and composition of the disk to numerically model its evolution as it is fed by the infalling cloud material. As the mass accretion rate of the disk onto the star determines its growth, we can calculate the stellar characteristics by interpolating its radius, luminosity, and temperature over the stellar mass from pre-calculated stellar evolution models. The density and midplane temperature of the disk then allow us to model the interactions between the disk and potential planets and determine their migration. At the end of the collapse phase, when the disk reaches its maximum mass, it pursues its viscous spreading, similarly to the evolution from a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN). In addition, we establish a timeline equivalence between the MMSN and a "collapse-formed disk" that would be older by about 2 Myr. We can save various types of planets from a fatal type-I inward migration: in particular, planetary embryos can avoid falling on the star by becoming trapped at the heat transition barriers and at most sublimation lines (except the silicates one). One of the novelties concerns the possible trapping of putative giant planets around a few astronomical units from the star around the end of the infall. Moreover, trapped planets may still follow the traps outward during the collapse phase and inward after it. Finally, this protoplanetary disk formation model shows the early possibilities of trapping planetary embryos at disk stages that are anterior by a few million years to the initial state of the MMSN approximation.},

Its mass and radius are marginally consistent with theories of structure of massive giant planets composed of pure H and He, and may require a large ({$\sim$}100 Earth mass) core to account for. The high eccentricity causes a 9-fold variation of insolation of the planet between peri- and apastron.

We show that even a single detection of biosignatures in the vicinity of our stellar system, in a survey of similar size to what will be obtainable in the next 2 decades, would affect significantly our prior belief on the frequency of life in the universe, even starting from a neutral or pessimistic stance. In particular, after such discovery, an initially agnostic observer would be led to conclude that there are more than 1 0 5 inhabited planets in the galaxy with a probability exceeding 95\%. However, this conclusion would be somewhat weakened by the viability of transfer of biological material over interstellar distances, as in panspermia scenarios. Conversely, the lack of significant evidence of biosignatures would have little effect, leaving the assessment of the abundance of life in the galaxy still largely undetermined.},

  abstract = {In this paper and a companion work, we show that a broad class of astrophysical accretion disk is dynam-mically unstable to axisymmetric disturbances in the presence of a weak magnetic field. Because of the ubiquity of magnetic fields, this result bears upon gaseous differentially rotating systems quite generally. This work presents a linear analysis of the instability. (The companion work presents the results of nonlinear numerical simulations.) The instability is local and extremely powerful. The maximal growth rate is of order the angular rotation velocity and is independent of the strength of the magnetic field, provided only that the energy density in the field is less than the thermal energy density. Unstable axisymmetric disturbances require the presence of a poloidal field component, and are indifferent to the presence of a toroidal component. The instability also requires that the angular velocity be decreasing outward. In the absence of a powerful dissi-pation process, there are no other requirements for instability. Fluid motions associated with the instability directly generate both poloidal and toroidal field components. We discuss the physical interpretation of the instability in detail. Conditions under which saturation occurs are suggested. The nonemergence of the classical Rayleigh criterion for shear instability in the limit of vanishing field strength is noted and explained. The instability is sensitive neither to disk boundary conditions nor to the constituative fluid properties. Its existence precludes the possibility of internal (noncompressive) wave propagation in a disk. If present in astro-physical disks, the instability, which has the character of an interchange, is very likely to lead to generic and efficient angular momentum transport, thereby resolving an outstanding theoretical puzzle.},

We manufacture synthetic planetary systems within a range of planet multiplicity and mutual inclination for comparison to the Kepler yield. We recover the observed number of systems containing between 2 and 5 transiting planets if every M dwarf hosts 6.1+/-1.9 planets with typical mutual inclinations of 2.0 +4.0-2.0 degrees. This range includes the Solar System in its coplanarity and multiplicity. However, similar to studies of Kepler exoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report that the number of singly-transiting planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a single population of multi-planet systems: a finding that cannot be attributed to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary systems we adopt a mixture model and find that 55 +23-12\% of planetary systems are either single or contain multiple planets with large mutual inclinations. Thus, we find that the so-called "Kepler dichotomy" holds for planets orbiting M dwarfs as well as Sun-like stars. Additionally, we compare stellar properties of the hosts to single and multiple transiting planets. For the brightest subset of stars in our sample we find intriguing, yet marginally significant evidence that stars hosting multiply-transiting systems are rotating more quickly, are closer to the midplane of the Milky Way, and are comparatively metal poor.

We report eight new circumstellar disks seen in silhouette against the background nebular light and about 30 dark disks embedded within the bright proplyds rimmed by ionization fronts. Deep narrowband {$\lambda$}6300 \AA{} images reveal skins of glowing [O I] emission associated with several disks embedded within bright proplyds. [O I] emission also surrounds one dark disk not surrounded by an ionization front; this object may be embedded within the photon-dominated, mostly neutral region behind the ionization front of the Orion Nebula. The intensity and morphology of the [O I] emission provides support for the photon-dominated-region models of externally irradiated circumstellar disks in which soft UV powers photoablation of the disk surface. Dozens of outflows powered by young stars have been discovered on the new images. More than 20 stellar jets emerge from the externally irradiated circumstellar disks or their associated young stars embedded within the Nebula. Most are one-sided (monopolar) subarcsecond-scale microjets, too small to be seen on ground-based images against the bright background nebular light. Additionally, wide-angle winds from 10 young stars in the outskirts of the Nebula power large-scale bow shocks facing the Trapezium OB stars. These shocks may be produced by wind-wind interactions where the T-Tauri winds interact with the outflow of plasma from the core of M42. The largest such structure, associated with the star LL Ori, contains a number of compact high-proper-motion clumps moving almost tangentially to the bow shock. The new data are combined with older HST images to determine proper motions for many nebular features. Neither the LL Ori type bow shocks in the outskirts of the nebula nor the H{$\alpha$} + [O III] arcs that surround many proplyds near the Trapezium show measurable proper motions and are therefore stationary structures. However, most other bow-shaped features not centered on young stars exhibit large proper motions, with velocities ranging from 50 to 300 km s-1. The sources of many of these moving features remain unknown. The proper-motion survey of the nebular core reveals the presence of about a dozen new large-scale (\textbackslash textgreater0.1 pc) outflow complexes. Many of these new outflows originate from the vicinity of the high-luminosity OMC-1S infrared and submillimeter source complex located southwest of the Trapezium. These supersonic features provide evidence that stellar outflows inject large amounts of kinetic energy into the nebula. However, a quantitative analysis indicates that their total power is small compared with the power in the plasma flowing away from the main nebular ionization front.

It is separated from the other planets by p.d.f. concavities from both sides. It has at least two-sigma significance.

This would cause Saturn to deviate from Newtonian expectations by 7000({$\alpha$}/0.4) km over 15 yr, starting from known initial position and velocity on a near-circular orbit. We demonstrate that this prediction should not be significantly altered by the postulated dipole haloes of other planets due to the rather small region in which each planet's gravity dominates over that of the Sun. The orbit of Saturn should similarly be little affected by a possible ninth planet in the outer Solar System and by the Galactic gravity causing a non-spherical distribution of gravitational dipoles several kAU from the Sun. Radio tracking of the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn yields a 5{$\sigma$} upper limit of 160 m on deviations from its conventionally calculated trajectory. These measurements imply a much more stringent upper limit on {$\alpha$} than the minimum required for consistency with rotation curve data. Therefore, no value of {$\alpha$} can simultaneously match all available constraints, falsifying the gravitational dipole theory in its current form at extremely high significance.},

The sample includes 63 disks where two types of measurements are available: i) spatially-resolved disk images revealing the radial distribution of disk pebbles (mm-cm dust grains), from millimeter observations with ALMA or the SMA, and ii) infrared molecular emission spectra as observed with Spitzer. The line flux ratios of H2O with HCN, C2H2, and CO2 all anti-correlate with the dust disk radius R\$\_\{dust\}\$, expanding previous results found by Najita et al. (2013) for HCN/H2O and the dust disk mass. By normalization with the dependence on accretion luminosity common to all molecules, only the H2O luminosity maintains a detectable anti-correlation with disk radius, suggesting that the strongest underlying relation is between H2O and R\$\_\{dust\}\$. If R\$\_\{dust\}\$ is set by large-scale pebble drift, and if molecular luminosities trace the elemental budgets of inner disk warm gas, these results can be naturally explained with scenarios where the inner disk chemistry is fed by sublimation of oxygen-rich icy pebbles migrating inward from the outer disk. Anti-correlations are also detected between all molecular luminosities and the infrared index n\$\_\{13-30\}\$, which is sensitive to the presence and size of an inner disk dust cavity. Overall, these relations suggest a physical interconnection between dust and gas evolution both locally and across disk scales. We discuss fundamental predictions to test this interpretation and study the interplay between pebble drift, inner disk depletion, and the chemistry of planet-forming material.},

  abstract = {With the growth of comparative exoplanetology, it is increasingly clear that investigating the relationships between inner and outer planets plays a key role in discriminating between competing formation and evolution models. To do so, it is important to probe the inner region of systems hosting long-period giants in search for undetected lower-mass planetary companions. In this work we present our results on the K-dwarf star BD-11{$\sim$}4672, already known to host a long-period giant planet, as the first output of a subsample of the GAPS programme specifically aimed at assessing the impact of inefficient migration of planets formed beyond the snowline by searching for Neptune-mass and super-Earths planetary companions of known longer-period giants. The high-precision HARPS-N observations of BD-11{$\sim$}4672 are used in conjunction with literature time series in order to search for additional inner planetary signals to be fitted using differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo. The long-term stability of the new orbital solutions is tested by N-body dynamical simulations. We report the detection of BD-11{$\sim$}4672{$\sim$}c, a new Neptune-mass planet with an orbital period of \$74.20\_\{-0.08\}\^\{+0.06\}\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashrm\{d\}\$, eccentricity \$0.40\_\{-0.15\}\^\{+0.13\}\$, semimajor axis \$0.30\textbackslash backslashpm0.01\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashrm\{au\}\$ and minimum mass \$15.37\_\{-2.81\}\^\{+2.97\}\textbackslash backslash,M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ orbiting slightly outside the inner edge of the optimistic circumstellar habitable zone. In order to assess its impact on the dynamical stability of the habitable zone we compute the angular momentum deficit of the system, showing that planet c has a severe negative impact on the stability of possible additional lower-mass temperate planets. The BD-11{$\sim$}4672 system is notable for its architecture, hosting both a long-period giant planet and an inner lower-mass planet, the latter being also among the most eccentric Neptune-mass planets known at similar periods.},

Here we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-min cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250+/-70 exoplanets (90\% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 Earth-radii. Furthermore, we predict an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M-dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 Earth-radii with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.},

We consider a range of stellar evolutionary models and incorporate the frequency-dependent effective viscosity acting on equilibrium tides based on the latest simulations. We compare the tidal flow and dissipation obtained with the conventional equilibrium tide, which is strictly invalid in convection zones, finding that the latter typically over-predicts the dissipation by a factor of 2-3. Dissipation of inertial waves is computed using a frequency-averaged formalism accounting for realistic stellar structure for the first time, and is the dominant mechanism for binary circularization and synchronization on the main sequence. Dissipation of gravity waves in the radiation zone assumes these waves to be fully damped (e.g.{$\sim$}by wave breaking), and is the dominant mechanism for planetary orbital decay. We calculate the critical planetary mass required for wave breaking as a function of stellar mass and age, and show that this mechanism predicts destruction of many hot Jupiters but probably not Earth-mass planets on the main sequence. We apply our results to compute tidal quality factors following stellar evolution, and tidal evolutionary timescales, for the orbital decay of hot Jupiters, and the spin synchronization and circularization of binary stars. We also provide predictions for shifts in transit arrival times due to tidally-driven orbital decay of hot Jupiters that may be detected with NGTS, TESS or PLATO.},

If the orbital parameters of discovered transiting planets are known, as from follow-up radial velocity observations, then the transit-detected planet population is easily debiased of this effect. The duration of a planet's transit depends upon of its eccentricity and longitude of periastron; transits near periastron are shorter, and those near apoastron last longer, for a given impact parameter. If fitting for the stellar radius with the other transit parameters, this effect causes a systematic error in the resulting measurements. If the stellar radius is instead held fixed at a value measured independently, then it is possible to place a lower limit on the planet's eccentricity using photometry alone. Orbital accelerations cause a difference in the planet's ingress and egress durations that lead to an asymmetry in the transit lightcurve that could be used along with the transit velocity measurement to uniquely measure the planet's eccentricity and longitude of periapsis. However, the effect is too small to be measured with current technology. The habitability of transiting terrestrial planets found by Kepler depends on those planets' orbital eccentricities. While Kepler will be able to place lower limits on those planets' orbital eccentricity, the actual value for any given planet will likely remain unknown.},

  abstract = {Main-sequence stars earlier than spectral-type {$\sim$} F6 or so are expected to rotate rapidly due to their radiative exteriors. This rapid rotation leads to an oblate stellar figure. It also induces the photosphere to be hotter (by up to several thousand kelvin) at the pole than at the equator as a result of a process called gravity darkening that was first predicted by von Zeipel. Transits of extrasolar planets across such a non-uniform, oblate disk yield unusual and distinctive lightcurves that can be used to determine the relative alignment of the stellar rotation pole and the planet orbit normal. This spin-orbit alignment can be used to constrain models of planet formation and evolution. Orderly planet formation and migration within a disk that is coplanar with the stellar equator will result in spin-orbit alignment. More violent planet-planet scattering events should yield spin-orbit misaligned planets. Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of transits of lower-mass stars show that some planets are spin-orbit aligned, and some are not. Since Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements are difficult around rapid rotators, lightcurve photometry may be the best way to determine the spin-orbit alignment of planets around massive stars. The Kepler mission will monitor {$\sim$} 104 of these stars within its sample. The lightcurves of any detected planets will allow us to probe the planet formation process around high-mass stars for the first time. \textcopyright{} 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

  abstract = {The determination of an exoplanet as rocky is critical for the assessment of planetary habitability. Observationally, the number of small-radius, transiting planets with accompanying mass measurements is insufficient for a robust determination of the transitional mass or radius. Theoretically, models predict that rocky planets can grow large enough to become gas giants when they reach {$\sim$}10 MEarth, but the transitional mass remains unknown. Here I show how transit data, interpreted in the context of tidal theory, can reveal the critical radius that separates rocky and gaseous exoplanets. Standard tidal models predict that rocky exoplanets' orbits are tidally circularized much more rapidly than gaseous bodies', suggesting the former will tend to be found on circular orbits at larger semi-major axes than the latter. Well-sampled transits can provide a minimum eccentricity of the orbit, allowing a measurement of this differential circularization. I show that this effect should be present in the data from the Kepler spacecraft, but is not apparent. Instead, it appears that there is no evidence of tidal circularization at any planetary radius, probably because the publicly-available data, particularly the impact parameters, are not accurate enough. I also review the bias in the transit duration towards values that are smaller than that of planets on circular orbits, stressing that the azimuthal velocity of the planet determines the transit duration. The ensemble of Kepler planet candidates may be able to determine the critical radius between rocky and gaseous exoplanets, tidal dissipation as a function of planetary radius, and discriminate between tidal models.},

  abstract = {Potentially habitable planets can orbit close enough to their host star that the differential gravity across their diameters can produce an elongated shape. Frictional forces inside the planet prevent the bulges from aligning perfectly with the host star and result in torques that alter the planet's rotational angular momentum. Eventually the tidal torques fix the rotation rate at a specific frequency, a process called tidal locking. Tidally locked planets on circular orbits will rotate synchronously, but those on eccentric orbits will either librate or rotate super-synchronously. Although these features of tidal theory are well known, a systematic survey of the rotational evolution of potentially habitable exoplanets using classic equilibrium tide theories has not been undertaken. I calculate how habitable planets evolve under two commonly used models and find, for example, that one model predicts that the Earth's rotation rate would have synchronized after 4.5 Gyr if its initial rotation period was 3 days, it had no satellites, and it always maintained the modern Earth's tidal properties. Lower mass stellar hosts will induce stronger tidal effects on potentially habitable planets, and tidal locking is possible for most planets in the habitable zones of GKM dwarf stars. For fast-rotating planets, both models predict eccentricity growth and that circularization can only occur once the rotational frequency is similar to the orbital frequency. The orbits of potentially habitable planets of very late M dwarfs ([InlineEquation not available: see fulltext.]) are very likely to be circularized within 1 Gyr, and hence, those planets will be synchronous rotators. Proxima b is almost assuredly tidally locked, but its orbit may not have circularized yet, so the planet could be rotating super-synchronously today. The evolution of the isolated and potentially habitable Kepler planet candidates is computed and about half could be tidally locked. Finally, projected TESS planets are simulated over a wide range of assumptions, and the vast majority of potentially habitable cases are found to tidally lock within 1 Gyr. These results suggest that the process of tidal locking is a major factor in the evolution of most of the potentially habitable exoplanets to be discovered in the near future.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of wt\% of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. In order to understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present magmoc, a versatile magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma ocean-atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth-oceans. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f and g most likely followed the extremely wet scenario with a prolonged magma ocean phase of at least 250 Myr. Planet e probably followed the dry or intermediate track, and may or may not have possessed little water vapour or oxygen in the atmosphere at the time of mantle solidification. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3-5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

We first show that considering a planet freely migrating in a disk without self-gravity leads to a significant overestimate of the migration rate. The overestimate can reach a factor of two for a disk having three times the surface density of the minimum mass solar nebula. Unbiased drift rates may be obtained only by considering a planet and a disk orbiting within the same gravitational potential. In a second part, the disk self-gravity is taken into account. We confirm that the disk gravity enhances the differential Lindblad torque with respect to the situation where neither the planet nor the disk feels the disk gravity. This enhancement only depends on the Toomre parameter at the planet location. It is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the spurious one induced by assuming a planet migrating in a disk without self-gravity. We confirm that the torque enhancement due to the disk gravity can be entirely accounted for by a shift of Lindblad resonances, and can be reproduced by the use of an anisotropic pressure tensor. We do not find any significant impact of the disk gravity on the corotation torque.},

Planet-disc forces are large, and the characteristic times for the evolution of planets orbital elements are much shorter than the lifetime of protoplanetary discs.

  abstract = {The growing body of observational data on extrasolar planets and protoplanetary disks has stimulated intense research on planet formation and evolution in the past few years. The extremely diverse, sometimes unexpected physical and orbital characteristics of exoplanets lead to frequent updates on the mainstream scenarios for planet formation and evolution, but also to the exploration of alternative avenues. The aim of this review is to bring together classical pictures and new ideas on the formation, orbital and internal evolutions of planets, highlighting the key role of the protoplanetary disk in the various parts of the theory. We begin by briefly reviewing the conventional mechanism of core accretion by the growth of planetesimals, and discuss a relatively recent model of core growth through the accretion of pebbles. We review the basic physics of planet-disk interactions, recent progress in this area, and discuss their role in observed planetary systems. We address the most important effects of planets internal evolution, like cooling and contraction, the mass-luminosity relation, and the bulk composition expressed in the mass-radius and mass-mean density relations.},

  abstract = {Today, with the large number of detected exoplanets and improved measurements, we can reach the next step of planetary characterization. Classifying different populations of planets is not only important for our understanding of the demographics of various planetary types in the galaxy, but also for our understanding of planet formation. We explore the nature of two regimes in the planetary mass-radius (M-R) relation. We suggest that the transition between the two regimes of''small'' and''large'' planets, occurs at a mass of 124 {$\pm$}7, M{$\oplus$} and a radius of 12.1 {$\pm$}0.5, R{$\oplus$}. Furthermore, the M-R relation is R {$\propto$} M0.55{$\pm$}0.02 and R {$\propto$} M0.01{$\pm$}0.02 for small and large planets, respectively. We suggest that the location of the breakpoint is linked to the onset of electron degeneracy in hydrogen, and therefore, to the planetary bulk composition. Specifically, it is the characteristic minimal mass of a planet which consists of mostly hydrogen and helium, and therefore its M-R relation is determined by the equation of state of these materials. We compare the M-R relation from observational data with the one derived by population synthesis calculations and show that there is a good qualitative agreement between the two samples.},

  abstract = {Context. The stars in the Milky Way thin and thick disks can be distinguished by several properties such as metallicity and kinematics. It is not clear whether the two populations also differ in the properties of planets orbiting the stars. In order to study this, a careful analysis of both the chemical composition and mass detection limits is required for a sufficiently large sample. Currently, this information is still limited only to large radial-velocity (RV) programs. Based on the recently published archival database of the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph, we present a first analysis of low-mass (small) planet occurrence rates in a sample of thin- and thick-disk stars. Aims. We aim to assess the effects of stellar properties on planet occurrence rates and to obtain first estimates of planet occurrence rates in the thin and thick disks of the Galaxy. As a baseline for comparison, we also aim to provide an updated value for the small close-in planet occurrence rate and compare it to results of previous RV and transit (Kepler) works. Methods. We used archival HARPS RV datasets to calculate detection limits of a sample of stars that were previously analysed for their elemental abundances. For stars with known planets we first subtracted the Keplerian orbit. We then used this information to calculate planet occurrence rates according to a simplified Bayesian model in different regimes of stellar and planet properties. Results. Our results suggest that metal-poor stars and more massive stars host fewer low-mass close-in planets. We find the occurrence rates of these planets in the thin and thick disks to be comparable. In the iron-poor regimes, we find these occurrence rates to be significantly larger at the high-{$\alpha$} region (thick-disk stars) as compared with the low-{$\alpha$} region (thin-disk stars). In general, we find the average number of close-in small planets (2\textendash 100 days, 1\textendash 20 M) per star (FGK-dwarfs) to be: n\textasciimacron{} p = 0.36 {$\pm$} 0.05, while the fraction of stars with planets is (Formula Presented). Qualitatively, our results agree well with previous estimates based on RV and Kepler surveys. Conclusions. This work provides a first estimate of the close-in small planet occurrence rates in the solar neighbourhood of the thin and thick disks of the Galaxy. It is unclear whether there are other stellar properties related to the Galactic context that affect small-planet occurrence rates, or if it is only the combined effects of stellar metal content and mass. A future larger sample of stars and planets is needed to address those questions.},

  abstract = {The planetary systems detected so far already exhibit a wide diversity of architectures, and various methods are proposed to study quantitatively this diversity. Straightforward ways to quantify the difference between two systems and more generally, two sets of multiplanetary systems, are useful tools in the study of this diversity. In this work we present a novel approach, using a Weighted extension of the Energy Distance (WED) metric, to quantify the difference between planetary systems on the logarithmic period-radius plane. We demonstrate the use of this metric and its relation to previously introduced descriptive measures to characterise the arrangements of Kepler planetary systems. By applying exploratory machine learning tools, we attempt to find whether there is some order that can be ascribed to the set of Kepler multiplanet system architectures. Based on WED, the 'Sequencer', which is such an automatic tool, identifies a progression from small and compact planetary systems to systems with distant giant planets. It is reassuring to see that a WED-based tool indeed identifies this progression. Next, we extend WED to define the Inter-Catalogue Energy Distance (ICED) - a distance metric between sets of multiplanetary systems. We have made the specific implementation presented in the paper available to the community through a public repository. We suggest to use these metrics as complementary tools in attempting to compare between architectures of planetary system, and in general, catalogues of planetary systems.},

We analyse the evolution and properties of a large sample of protostellar discs formed in a radiation hydrodynamical simulation of star cluster formation. Due to the chaotic nature of the star formation process, we find an enormous diversity of young protostellar discs, including misaligned discs, and discs whose orientations vary with time. Star-disc interactions truncate discs and produce multiple systems. Discs may be destroyed in dynamical encounters and/or through ram-pressure stripping, but reform by later gas accretion. We quantify the distributions of disc mass and radii for protostellar ages up to \$\textbackslash backslashapprox 10\^5\$ yrs. For low-mass protostars, disc masses tend to increase with both age and protostellar mass. Disc radii range from of order ten to a few hundred au, grow in size on timescales \$\textbackslash backslashle 10\^4\$ yr, and are smaller around lower-mass protostars. The radial surface density profiles of isolated protostellar discs are flatter than the minimum mass solar nebula model, typically scaling as \$\textbackslash backslashSigma \textbackslash backslashpropto r\^\{-1\}\$. Disc to protostar mass ratios rarely exceed two, with a typical range of \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm d\}/M\_* = 0.1-1\$ to ages \$\textbackslash backslashle 10\^4\$ yrs and decreasing thereafter. We quantify the relative orientation angles of circumstellar discs and the orbit of bound pairs of protostars, finding a preference for alignment that strengths with decreasing separation. We also investigate how the orientations of the outer parts of discs differ from the protostellar and inner disc spins for isolated protostars and pairs.},

In this work ephemerides are updated for 22 Kepler planets and 4 Kepler planet candidates, constituting all Kepler planets and candidates with sufficient signal to noise in the TESS 2min dataset. A purely photometric method is utilised here to allow ephemeris updates for planets even when they do not posses significant radial velocity data. The obtained ephemerides are of very high precision and at least seven years 'fresher' than archival ephemerides. In particular, significantly reduced period uncertainties for Kepler-411d, Kepler-538b and the candidates K00075.01/K00076.01 are reported. O-C diagrams were generated for all objects, with the most interesting ones discussed here. Updated TTV fits of five known multiplanet systems with significant TTVs were also attempted (Kepler-18, Kepler-25, Kepler-51, Kepler-89, and Kepler-396), however these suffered from the comparative scarcity and dimness of these systems in TESS. Despite these difficulties, TESS has once again shown itself to be an incredibly powerful follow-up instrument as well as a planet-finder in its own right. Extension of the methods used in this paper to the 30min-cadence TESS data and TESS extended mission has the potential to yield updated ephemerides of hundreds more systems in the future.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that the concluding stages of giant planet formation are accompanied by the development of large-scale meridional flow of gas inside the planetary Hill sphere. This circulation feeds a circumplanetary disk that viscously expels gaseous material back into the parent nebula, maintaining the system in a quasi-steady state. Here we investigate the formation of natural satellites of Jupiter and Saturn within the framework of this newly outlined picture. We begin by considering the long-term evolution of solid material, and demonstrate that the circumplanetary disk can act as a global dust trap, where \$s\_\{\textbackslash backslashbullet\}\textbackslash backslashsim0.1-10\textbackslash backslash,\$mm grains achieve a hydrodynamical equilibrium, facilitated by a balance between radial updraft and aerodynamic drag. This process leads to a gradual increase in the system's metallicity, and eventually culminates in the gravitational fragmentation of the outer regions of the solid sub-disk into \$\textbackslash backslashmathcal\{R\}\textbackslash backslashsim100\textbackslash backslash,\$km satellitesimals. Subsequently, satellite conglomeration ensues via pairwise collisions, but is terminated when disk-driven orbital migration removes the growing objects from the satellitesimal feeding zone. The resulting satellite formation cycle can repeat multiple times, until it is brought to an end by photo-evaporation of the parent nebula. Numerical simulations of the envisioned formation scenario yield satisfactory agreement between our model and the known properties of the Jovian and Saturnian moons.},

We uniformly analyze 70 photometric light curves of 33 transiting planets using our custom pipeline, which implements pixel level decorrelation. We use this survey to understand how infrared photometry traces changes in atmospheric chemical properties as a function of planetary temperature. We compare our measurements to a grid of 1D radiative-convective equilibrium forward atmospheric models which include disequilibrium chemistry. We explore various strengths of vertical mixing (Kzz = 0 - 10\^12 cm2/s) as well as two chemical compositions (1x and 30x solar). Results. We find that, on average, Spitzer probes a difference of 0.5 atmospheric scale heights between 3.6 and 4.5um, which is measured at 7.5sigma level of significance. We find that the coolest planets show a lack of methane compared to expectations, which has also been reported by previous studies of individual objects. We show that the sample of coolest planets rule out 1x solar composition with \textbackslash textgreater3sigma confidence while supporting low vertical mixing (Kzz = 10\^8 cm2/s). On the other hand, we find that the hot planets are best explained by models with 1x solar metallicity and high vertical mixing (Kzz = 10\^12 cm2/s). We interpret this as the lofting of CH4 to the upper atmospheric layers. Changing the interior temperature changes the expectation for equilibrium chemistry in deep layers, hence the expectation of disequilibrium chemistry higher up. We also find a significant scatter in the transmission signatures of the mid-temperate and ultra-hot planets, likely due to increased atmospheric diversity, without the need to invoke higher metallicities. Additionally, we compare Spitzer transmission with emission for the same planets and find no evidence for correlation.},

  abstract = {Planets intermediate in size between the Earth and Neptune, and orbiting closer to their host stars than Mercury does the Sun, are the most common type of planet revealed by exoplanet surveys over the last quarter century. Results from NASA's Kepler mission have revealed a bimodality in the radius distribution of these objects, with a relative underabundance of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. This bimodality suggests that sub-Neptunes are mostly rocky planets that were born with primary atmospheres a few percent by mass accreted from the protoplanetary nebula. Planets above the radius gap were able to retain their atmospheres ("gas-rich super-Earths"), while planets below the radius gap lost their atmospheres and are stripped cores ("true super-Earths"). The mechanism that drives atmospheric loss for these planets remains an outstanding question, with photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss being the prime candidates. As with the mass-loss mechanism, there are two contenders for the origins of the solids in sub-Neptune planets: the migration model involves the growth and migration of embryos from beyond the ice line, while the drift model involves inward-drifting pebbles that coagulate to form planets close-in. Atmospheric studies have the potential to break degeneracies in interior structure models and place additional constraints on the origins of these planets. However, most atmospheric characterization efforts have been confounded by aerosols. Observations with upcoming facilities are expected to finally reveal the atmospheric compositions of these worlds, which are arguably the first fundamentally new type of planetary object identified from the study of exoplanets.},

We also measure the relative motion of KELT-2A and -2B over a baseline of 38years, robustly demonstrating for the first time that the stars are bound.

In this work, we present a coupled analysis of dynamical tidal dissipation and atmospheric mass loss for exoplanets in XUV irradiated environments. As our primary application, we use this model to study the TRAPPIST-1 system, and place constraints on the interior structure and orbital evolution of the planets. We start by reporting on a UV continuum flux measurement (centered around \$\textbackslash backslashsim1900\$ Angstroms) for the star TRAPPIST-1, based on 300 ks of Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory data, and which enables an estimate of the XUV-driven thermal escape arising from XUV photo-dissociation for each planet. We find that the X-ray flaring luminosity, measured from our X-ray detections, of TRAPPIST-1 is 5.6 \$\textbackslash backslashtimes\$10\$\^\{-4\} L\_\{*\}\$, while the full flux including non-flaring periods is 6.1 \$\textbackslash backslashtimes\$10\$\^\{-5\} L\_\{*\}\$, when \$L\_\{*\}\$ is TRAPPIST-1's bolometric luminosity. We then construct a model that includes both atmospheric mass-loss and tidal evolution, and requires the planets to attain their present-day orbital elements during this coupled evolution. We use this model to constrain the ratio \$Q'=3Q/2k\_\{2\}\$ for each planet. Finally, we use additional numerical models implemented with the Virtual Planet Simulator \$\textbackslash backslash\$texttt\{VPLanet\} to study ocean retention for these planets using our derived system parameters.},

These data contain valuable information for the dual purposes of planet detection via the measured RVs and stellar characterization via the co-added spectra. However, considerable data analysis challenges exist in extracting these data products from the observed spectra at the highest possible precision, including the issue of poorly-characterized telluric absorption features and the common use of an assumed stellar spectral template. In both of these examples, precision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using the data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously extract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using a linear model (in the log of flux). The model employs a convex objective and convex regularization to keep the optimization of the spectral components fast. We implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package which uses TensorFlow in one of its first non-neural-network applications to astronomical data. In this work, we demonstrate the performance of wobble on archival HARPS spectra. We recover the canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV evolution of the M dwarf Barnard's Star, and retrieve the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the Hot Jupiter HD 189733b. The method additionally produces extremely high-S/N composite stellar spectra and detailed time-variable telluric spectra, which we also present here.},

This article summarizes a workshop held on March, 2014, on the potential of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to revolutionize our knowledge of the physical properties of exoplanets through transit observations. JWST's unique combination of high sensitivity and broad wavelength coverage will enable the accurate measurement of transits with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Most importantly, JWST spectroscopy will investigate planetary atmospheres to determine atomic and molecular compositions, to probe vertical and horizontal structure, and to follow dynamical evolution, i.e., exoplanet weather. JWST will sample a diverse population of planets of varying masses and densities in a wide variety of environments characterized by a range of host star masses and metallicities, orbital semi-major axes, and eccentricities. A broad program of exoplanet science could use a substantial fraction of the overall JWST mission.}

  abstract = {One-dimensional, convective, vertical structure models and one dimensional time-dependent, radial diffusion models are combined to create a self-consistent picture in which FU Orionis outbursts occur in young stellar objects (YSOs) as the result of a large-scale, self-regulated, thermal ionization instability in the surrounding protostellar accretion disk. Although active accretion disks have long been postulated to be ubiquitous among low-mass YSOs, few constraints have until now been imposed on physical conditions in these disks. By fitting the results of time-dependent disk models to observed timescales of FU Orionis events, we estimate the magnitude of the effective viscous stress in the inner disk (r approximately less than 1 AU) to be, in accordance with an ad hoc 'alpha' prescription, the product of the local sound speed, pressure scale height, and an efficiency factor alpha of 10-4 where hydrogen is neutral and 103 where hydrogen is ionized. We hypothesize that all YSOs receive infall onto their outer disks which is steady (or slowly declining with time) and that FU Orionis outbursts are self-regulated, disk outbursts which occur only in systems which transport matter inward at a rate sufficiently high to cause hydrogen to be ionized in the inner disk. We estimate a critical mass flux of dmcrit/dt = 5 x 107 solar mass/yr independent of the magnitude of alpha for systems with one solar mass, three solar radius central objects. Infall accretion rates in the range of dmin/dt = 1-10) x 10-6 solar mass/yr produce observed FU Orionis timescales consistent with estimates of spherical molecular cloud core collapse rates. Modeled ionization fronts are typically initiated near the inner edge of the disk and propogate out to a distance of several tens of stellar radii. Beyond this region, the disk transports mass steadily inward at the supplied constant infall rate. Mass flowing through the innermost disk annulus is equal to dmin/dt only in a time-averaged sense and is regulated by the ionization of hydrogen in the inner disk such that long intervals (approximately 1000 yr) of low-mass flux: (1-30) x 10-8 solar mass/yr are punctuated by short intervals (approximately 100 yr) of high-mass flux: (1-30) x 10-5 solar mass/yr. Timescales and mass fluxes derived for quiescent and outburst stages are consistent with estimates from observations of T Tauri and FU Orionis systems, respectively.},

  abstract = {Context: The lower limit to the distribution of orbital periods P for the current population of close-in exoplanets shows a distinctive discontinuity located at approximately one Jovian mass. Most smaller planets have orbital periods longer than P {$\sim$} 2.5 days, while higher masses are found down to P {$\sim$} 1 day. Aims. We analyze whether this observed mass-period distribution could be explained in terms of the combined effects of stellar tides and the interactions of planets with an inner cavity in the gaseous disk. Methods. We performed a series of hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of single-planet systems in a gaseous disk with an inner cavity mimicking the inner boundary of the disk. The subsequent tidal evolution is analyzed assuming that orbital eccentricities are small and stellar tides are dominant. Results. We find that most of the close-in exoplanet population is consistent with an inner edge of the protoplanetary disk being located at approximately P {$\geq$} 2 days for solar-type stars, in addition to orbital decay having been caused by stellar tides with a specific tidal parameter on the order of Q{${'}$} *107. The data is broadly consistent with planets more massive than one Jupiter mass undergoing type II migration, crossing the gap, and finally halting at the interior 2/1 mean-motion resonance with the disk edge. Smaller planets do not open a gap in the disk and remain trapped in the cavity edge. CoRoT-7b appears detached from the remaining exoplanet population, apparently requiring additional evolutionary effects to explain its current mass and semimajor axis. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2011.},

  abstract = {With no analogues in the Solar System, the discovery of thousands of exoplanets with masses and radii intermediate between Earth and Neptune was one of the big surprises of exoplanet science. These super-Earths and sub-Neptunes probably represent the most common outcome of planet formation1,2. Mass and radius measurements indicate a diversity in bulk composition much wider than for gas giants3; however, direct spectroscopic detections of molecular absorption and constraints on the gas mixing ratios have largely remained limited to planets more massive than Neptune4\textendash 6. Here we analyse a combined Hubble/Spitzer Space Telescope dataset of 12 transits and 20 eclipses of the sub-Neptune exoplanet GJ 3470 b, whose mass of 12.6 M{$\oplus$} places it near the halfway point between previously studied Neptune-like exoplanets (22\textendash 23 M{$\oplus$})5\textendash 7 and exoplanets known to have rocky densities (7 M{$\oplus$})8. Obtained over many years, our dataset provides a robust detection of water absorption (\textbackslash textgreater5{$\sigma$}) and a thermal emission detection from the lowest irradiated planet to date. We reveal a low-metallicity, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere similar to that of a gas giant, but strongly depleted in methane gas. The low metallicity (O/H = 0.2\textendash 18.0) sets important constraints on the potential planet formation processes at low masses as well as the subsequent accretion of solids. The low methane abundance indicates that methane is destroyed much more efficiently than previously predicted, suggesting that the CH4/CO transition curve has to be revisited for close-in planets. Finally, we also find a sharp drop in the cloud opacity at 2\textendash 3 \textmu m, characteristic of Mie scattering, which enables narrow constraints on the cloud particle size and makes GJ 3470 b a key target for mid-infrared characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

Planet population synthesis provides such a link. The approach allows to study how different physical models of individual processes (e.g., proto-planetary disc structure and evolution, planetesimal formation, gas accretion, migration, etc.) affect the overall properties of the population of emerging planets. By necessity, planet population synthesis relies on simplified descriptions of complex processes. These descriptions can be obtained from more detailed specialised simulations of these processes. The objective of this chapter is twofold: 1) provide an overview of the physics entering in the two main approaches to planet population synthesis and 2) present some of the results achieved as well as illustrate how it can be used to extract constraints on the models and to help interpret observations.},

The expected photometric precision will also allow CHEOPS to go beyond measuring only transits and to follow phase curves or to search for exo-moons, for example.

We report revised radii of 177,911 Kepler stars derived by combining parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 2 with the DR25 Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius precision is {$\approx$}8\%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4-5 over previous estimates for typical Kepler stars. We find that {$\approx$}67\% ({$\approx$}120,000) of all Kepler targets are main-sequence stars, {$\approx$}21\% ({$\approx$}37,000) are subgiants, and {$\approx$}12\% ({$\approx$}21,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes \textbackslash textgreater200 F{$\oplus$}and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to {$\approx$}2R{$\oplus$}) when compared to previous results.

Using the homogeneous Kepler stellar properties derived using Gaia Data Release 2 by Berger et al.

We measure the stellar mass dependence of the planet radius valley to be \$d \textbackslash backslashlog R\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{p\}\}\$/\$d \textbackslash backslashlog M\_\textbackslash backslashstar = 0.26\^\{+0.21\}\_\{-0.16\}\$, consistent with the slope predicted by a planet mass dependence on stellar mass (\$0.24-0.35\$) and core-powered mass-loss (0.33). We also find first evidence of a stellar age dependence of the planet populations straddling the radius valley. Specifically, we determine that the fraction of super-Earths (\$1-1.8 \textbackslash backslashmathrm\{R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$) to sub-Neptunes (\$1.8-3.5 \textbackslash backslashmathrm\{R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$) increases from \$0.61 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.09\$ at young ages (\textbackslash textless 1 Gyr) to \$1.00 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.10\$ at old ages (\textbackslash textgreater 1 Gyr), consistent with the prediction by core-powered mass-loss that the mechanism shaping the radius valley operates over Gyr timescales. Additionally, we find a tentative decrease in the radii of relatively cool (\$F\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{p\}\} \textbackslash textless 150 \textbackslash backslashmathrm\{F\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$) sub-Neptunes over Gyr timescales, which suggests that these planets may possess H/He envelopes instead of higher mean molecular weight atmospheres.

  abstract = {It is well known that giant planets open deep gaps in their natal gaseous protoplanetary discs. However, it is unclear how gas accretion onto growing planets influences the shape and depth of their growing gaps. We perform isothermal hydrodynamical simulations with the Fargo-2D1D code in which planets accrete gas within full discs that range from 0.1 to 260 AU. The gas accretion routine uses a sink cell approach, where we use different accretion rates to cope with the large span of gas accretion rates in the literature. We find that the planetary gas accretion rate increases for larger disc aspect ratios and larger viscosities. Our main result shows that gas accretion has an important impact on the gap opening mass: we find that when the disc responds slowly to a change in planetary mass (i.e. at low viscosity), the gap opening mass scales with the planetary accretion rate, with a higher gas accretion rate resulting in a larger gap opening mass. On the other hand, if the disc response time is short (i.e. at high viscosity), then gas accretion helps the planet carve a deep gap. As a consequence higher planetary gas accretion rates result in smaller gap opening masses. Our results have important implications for the derivation of planet masses from disc observations: depending on the planetary gas accretion rate, the derived masses from ALMA observations might be off by up to a factor 2. We discuss the consequence of the change of the gap opening mass on the evolution of planetary systems by taking the example of the Grand Tack scenario. Planetary gas accretion also impacts the stellar gas accretion, where we find only a small influence due to the presence of a gas accreting planet.},

  abstract = {It is widely known that giant planets have the capacity to open deep gaps in their natal gaseous protoplanetary discs. It is unclear, however, how gas accretion onto growing planets influences the shape and depth of their growing gaps. We performed isothermal hydrodynamical simulations with the Fargo-2D1D code, which assumes planets accreting gas within full discs that range from 0.1 to 260 AU. The gas accretion routine uses a sink cell approach, in which different accretion rates are used to cope with the broad range of gas accretion rates cited in the literature. We find that the planetary gas accretion rate increases for larger disc aspect ratios and greater viscosities. Our main results show that gas accretion has an important impact on the gap-opening mass: we find that when the disc responds slowly to a change in planetary mass (i.e., at low viscosity), the gap-opening mass scales with the planetary accretion rate, with a higher gas accretion rate resulting in a larger gap-opening mass. On the other hand, if the disc response time is short (i.e., at high viscosity), then gas accretion helps the planet carve a deep gap. As a consequence, higher planetary gas accretion rates result in smaller gap-opening masses. Our results have important implications for the derivation of planet masses from disc observations: depending on the planetary gas accretion rate, the derived masses from ALMA observations might be off by up to a factor of two. We discuss the consequences of the change in the gap-opening mass on the evolution of planetary systems based on the example of the grand tack scenario. Planetary gas accretion also impacts stellar gas accretion, where the influence is minimal due to the presence of a gas-accreting planet.},

  abstract = {From the masses of the planets orbiting the Sun, and the abundance of elements relative to hydrogen, it is estimated that when the Solar System formed, the circumstellar disk must have had a minimum mass of around 0.01 solar masses within about 100 astronomical units of the star. (One astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance.) The main constituent of the disk, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not efficiently emit radiation from the disk mass reservoir, and so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emission and lines of gaseous carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide emission generally indicates properties of the disk surface, and the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requires knowledge of the grain properties and the gas-to-dust mass ratio, which probably differ from their interstellar values. As a result, mass estimates vary by orders of magnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3-10 million years) star TW Hydrae, for which the range is 0.0005-0.06 solar masses. Here we report the detection of the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride from the direction of TW Hydrae. Hydrogen deuteride is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows the distribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the total mass. The detection of hydrogen deuteride, combined with existing observations and detailed models, implies a disk mass of more than 0.05 solar masses, which is enough to form a planetary system like our own. \textcopyright{} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In its first four years, MEarth discovered one transiting exoplanet, the 2.7 R{$\oplus$} planet GJ1214b. Here, we answer an outstanding question: in light of the bounty of small planets transiting small stars uncovered by the Kepler mission, should MEarth have found more than just one planet so far? We estimate MEarth's ensemble sensitivity to exoplanets by performing end-to-end simulations of 1.25 \texttimes{} 106 observations of 988 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs, gathered by MEarth between 2008 October and 2012 June. For 2\textendash 4 R{$\oplus$} planets, we compare this sensitivity to results from Kepler and find that MEarth should have found planets at a rate of 0.05\textendash 0.36 planets yr-1 in its first four years. As part of this analysis, we provide new analytic fits to the Kepler early M dwarf planet occurrence distribution. When extrapolating between Kepler's early M dwarfs and MEarth's mid-to-late M dwarfs, we find that assuming the planet occurrence distribution stays fixed with respect to planetary equilibrium temperature provides a good match to our detection of a planet with GJ1214b's observed properties. For larger planets, we find that the warm (600\textendash 700 K), Neptune-sized (4 R{$\oplus$}) exoplanets that transit early M dwarfs like Gl436 and GJ3470 occur at a rate of {$<$}0.15 star-1 (at 95\% confidence) around MEarth's later M dwarf targets. We describe a strategy with which MEarth can increase its expected planet yield by 2.5 \texttimes{} without new telescopes by shifting its sensitivity toward the smaller and cooler exoplanets that Kepler has demonstrated to be abundant.},

  abstract = {The search for young planets had its first breakthrough with the detection of the accreting planet PDS70b. To broaden our understanding of planet formation, in particular towards systems such as HR8799 and our Solar System, it is inevitable to study such systems during their formation. Our previous study on HD169142, one of the closest Herbig stars, points towards a shadow-casting protoplanetary candidate (Bertrang+2018). Here, we present follow-up observations to test our previously proposed hypothesis. In order to test for a moving shadow, this data set has to be as comparable as possible to our previous observation. Therefore, we obtain SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations using polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) in the same manner as we did before. We then set our new data into context with previous observations to follow structural changes in the disk over the course of 6 years. The comparison of the structures in HD 169142 over the course of three epochs reveals spatially resolved systematic changes in the position of the previously described surface brightness dip in the inner ring. We further find changes in the brightness structure in azimuthal direction along the ring. And finally, a comparison of our SPHERE/ZIMPOL data with recent ALMA observations reveals a wavelength dependent radial profile of the bright ring. The time-scale on which the changes in the ring's surface brightness occurs suggest that they are caused by a shadow cast by a 1-10Mj planet surrounded by dust. Being located at about 12au from the star, the shadow-casting candidate's orbit is comparable to those of the giant planets in our own Solar System. In addition, we find the first indications for temperature-induced instabilities in the ring. And finally, we trace a pressure maxima, for the first time spatially resolved, with a width of 4.5au.

  abstract = {Massive planetary cores embedded in protoplanetary discs are believed to accrete extended atmospheres, providing a pathway to forming gas giants and gas-rich super- Earths. The properties of these atmospheres strongly depend on the nature of the coupling between the atmosphere and the surrounding disc. We examine the formation of gaseous envelopes around massive planetary cores via three-dimensional inviscid and isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We focus the changes in the envelope properties as the core mass varies from low (sub-thermal) to high (super-thermal) values, a regime relevant to close-in super-Earths. We show that global envelope properties such as the amount of rotational support or turbulent mixing are mostly sensitive to the ratio of the Bondi radius of the core to its physical size. High-mass cores are fed by supersonic inflows arriving along the polar axis and shocking on the densest parts of the envelope, driving turbulence and mass accretion. Gas flows out of the core's Hill sphere in the equatorial plane, describing a global mass circulation through the envelope. The shell of shocked gas atop the core surface delimits regions of slow (inside) and fast (outside) material recycling by gas from the surrounding disc. While recycling hinders the runaway growth towards gas giants, the inner regions of protoplanetary atmospheres,},

To better understand the origin of these objects, we carry out hydrodynamical simulations of planetary cores embedded in a nascent protoplanetary disk. In this first paper of a series, to gain intuition as well as to develop useful diagnostics, we focus on two-dimensional simulations of the flow around protoplanetary cores. We use the pluto code to study isothermal and adiabatic envelopes around cores of sub- to super-thermal masses, fully resolving the envelope properties down to the core surface. Owing to the conservation of vortensity, envelopes acquire a substantial degree of rotational support when the core mass increases beyond the thermal mass, suggesting a limited applicability of one-dimensional models for describing the envelope structure. The finite size of the core (relatively large for super-Earths) also controls the amount of rotational support in the entire envelope. Steady non-axisymmetric shocks develop in the supersonic envelopes of high-mass cores, triggering mass accretion and turbulent mixing in their interiors. We also examine the influence of the gas self-gravity on the envelope structure. Although it only weakly alters the properties of the envelopes, the gas gravity has significant effect on the properties of the density waves triggered by the core in the protoplanetary disk.},

We investigate the properties of Larsons first and second cores following the evolution of the molecular cloud core until the formation of Larson's cores. We expand these collapse studies for the first time to span a wide range of initial cloud masses from 0.5 to 100 M. Methods. Understanding the complexity of the numerous physical processes involved in the very early stages of star formation requires detailed thermodynamical modelling in terms of radiation transport and phase transitions. For this we used a realistic gas equation of state via a density- and temperature-dependent adiabatic index and mean molecular weight to model the phase transitions. We used a grey treatment of radiative transfer coupled with hydrodynamics to simulate Larsons collapse in spherical symmetry. Results. We reveal a dependence of a variety of first core properties on the initial cloud mass. The first core radius and mass increase from the low-mass to intermediate-mass regime and decrease from the intermediate-mass to high-mass regime. The lifetime of first cores strongly decreases towards the intermediate- and high-mass regimes. Conclusions. Our studies show the presence of a transition region in the intermediate-mass regime. Low-mass protostars tend to evolve through two distinct stages of formation that are related to the first and second hydrostatic cores. In contrast, in the high-mass star formation regime, collapsing cloud cores rapidly evolve through the first collapse phase and essentially immediately form Larson's second cores.},

  abstract = {Substructures are ubiquitous in high resolution (sub-)millimeter continuum observations of circumstellar disks. They are possibly caused by forming planets embedded in the disk. To investigate the relation between observed substructures and young planets, we perform novel three-dimensional two-fluid (gas+1-mm-dust) hydrodynamic simulations of circumstellar disks with embedded planets (Neptune-, Saturn-, Jupiter-, 5 Jupiter-mass) at different orbital distances from the star (5.2AU, 30AU, 50AU). We turn these simulations into synthetic (sub-)millimeter ALMA images. We find that all but the Neptune-mass planet open annular gaps in both the gas and the dust component of the disk. We find that the temporal evolution of the dust density distribution is distinctly different of the gas'. For example, the planets cause significant vertical stirring of the dust in the circumstellar disk which opposes the vertical settling. This creates a thicker dust disk than disks without a planet. We find that this effect greatly influences the dust masses derived from the synthetic ALMA images. Comparing the dust disk masses in the 3D simulations and the ones derived from the 2D ALMA synthetic images, we find the former to be a factor of a few (up to 10) larger, pointing to that real disks might be significantly more massive than previously thought based on ALMA continuum images using the optically thin assumption and equation. Finally, we analyze the synthetic ALMA images and provide an empirical relationship between the planet mass and the width of the gap in the ALMA images including the effects of the beam size.},

Current models of the size-and radial evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks generally oversimplify either the radial evolution of the disk (by focussing at one single radius or by using steady state disk models) or they assume particle growth to proceed monodispersely or without fragmentation. Further studies of protoplanetary disks-such as observations, disk chemistry and structure calculations or planet population synthesis models-depend on the distribution of dust as a function of grain size and radial position in the disk. Aims. We attempt to improve upon current models to be able to investigate how the initial conditions, the build-up phase, and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk influence growth and transport of dust.

We quantify which conditions or environments are favorable for growth beyond the meter size barrier. High gas surface densities or zonal flows may help to overcome the problem of radial drift, however already a small amount of turbulence poses a much stronger obstacle for grain growth. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2010.},

  abstract = {Dust constitutes only about one percent of the mass of circumstellar disks, yet it is of crucial importance for the modeling of planet formation, disk chemistry, radiative transfer and observations. The initial growth of dust from sub-micron sized grains to planetesimals and also the radial transport of dust in disks around young stars is the topic of this thesis. Circumstellar dust is subject to radial drift, vertical settling, turbulent mixing, collisional growth, fragmentation and erosion. We approach this subject from three directions: analytical calculations, numerical simulations, and comparison to observations. We describe the physical and numerical concepts that go into a model which is able to simulate the radial and size evolution of dust in a gas disk which is viscously evolving over several million years. The resulting dust size distributions are compared to our analytical predictions and a simple recipe for obtaining steady-state dust size distributions is derived. With the numerical model at hand, we show that grain fragmentation can explain the fact that circumstellar disks are observed to be dust-rich for several million years. Finally, we investigate the challenges that observations present to the theory of grain evolution, namely that grains of millimeter sizes are observed at large distances from the star. We have found that under the assumption that radial drift is ineffective, we can reproduce some of the observed spectral indices and fluxes. Fainter objects point towards a reduced dust-to-gas ratio or lower dust opacities.},

The global size and spatial distribution of dust is an important ingredient in the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks and in the formation of larger bodies, such as planetesimals. Aims. We aim to derive simple equations that explain the global evolution of the dust surface density profile and the upper limit of the grain size distribution and which can readily be used for further modeling or for interpreting of observational data. Methods. We have developed a simple model that follows the upper end of the dust size distribution and the evolution of the dust surface density profile. This model is calibrated with state-of-the-art simulations of dust evolution, which treat dust growth, fragmentation, and transport in viscously evolving gas disks. Results. We find very good agreement between the full dust-evolution code and the toy model presented in this paper. We derive analytical profiles that describe the dust-to-gas ratios and the dust surface density profiles well in protoplanetary disks, as well as the radial flux by solid material "rain out", which is crucial for triggering any gravity assisted formation of planetesimals. We show that fragmentation is the dominating effect in the inner regions of the disk leading to a dust surface density exponent of-1.5, while the outer regions at later times can become drift-dominated, yielding a dust surface density exponent of-0.75. Our results show that radial drift is not efficient in fragmenting dust grains. This supports the theory that small dust grains are resupplied by fragmentation due to the turbulent state of the disk. \textcopyright{} 2012 ESO.},

  abstract = {The expectation that aerodynamic drag will force the solids in a gas-rich protoplanetary disk to spiral in toward the host star on short timescales is one of the fundamental problems in planet formation theory. The nominal efficiency of this radial drift process is in conflict with observations, suggesting that an empirical calibration of solid transport mechanisms in a disk is highly desirable. However, the fact that both radial drift and grain growth produce a similar particle size segregation in a disk (such that larger particles are preferentially concentrated closer to the star) makes it difficult to disentangle a clear signature of drift alone. We highlight a new approach, by showing that radial drift leaves a distinctive "fingerprint" in the dust surface density profile that is directly accessible to current observational facilities. Using an analytical framework for dust evolution, we demonstrate that the combined effects of drift and (viscous) gas drag naturally produce a sharp outer edge in the dust distribution (or, equivalently, a sharp decrease in the dust-to-gas mass ratio). This edge feature forms during the earliest phase in the evolution of disk solids, before grain growth in the outer disk has made much progress, and is preserved over longer timescales when both growth and transport effects are more substantial. The key features of these analytical models are reproduced in detailed numerical simulations, and are qualitatively consistent with recent millimeter-wave observations that find gas/dust size discrepancies and steep declines in dust continuum emission in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. \textcopyright{} 2014.

  abstract = {The solid content of circumstellar disks is inherited from the interstellar medium: dust particles of at most a micrometer in size. Protoplanetary disks are the environment where these dust grains need to grow at least 13 orders of magnitude in size. Our understanding of this growth process is far from complete, with different physics seemingly posing obstacles to this growth at various stages. Yet, the ubiquity of planets in our galaxy suggests that planet formation is a robust mechanism. This chapter focuses on the earliest stages of planet formation, the growth of small dust grains towards the gravitationally bound ``planetesimals'', the building blocks of planets. We will introduce some of the key physics involved in the growth processes and discuss how they are expected to shape the global behavior of the solid content of disks. We will consider possible pathways towards the formation of larger bodies and conclude by reviewing some of the recent observational advances in the field.},

  abstract = {Binary stars form from the same parent molecular cloud and thus have the same chemical composition. Forming planets take building material (solids) away from the surrounding protoplanetary disc. Assuming that the disc's accretion on to the star is the main process that clears the disc, the atmosphere of the star will show abundance reductions caused by the material accreted by the forming planet(s). If planets are only forming around one star of a binary system, the planet formation process can result in abundance differences in wide binary stars, if their natal protoplanetary discs do not interact during planet formation. Abundance differences in the atmospheres of wide binaries hosting giant planets have already been observed and linked to the formation location of giant planets. Here, we model how much building material is taken away for super-Earth planets that form inside/outside of the water ice line as well as ice giants forming inside/outside of the CO ice line. Our model predicts a significant abundance difference {$\delta$}[X/H] in the stellar atmospheres of the planet-hosting binary component. Our model predicts that super-Earths that form inside the water ice line (r \textbackslash textless rH2O) will result in an {$\delta$}[Fe/H]/{$\delta$}[O/H] abundance difference in the their host star that is a factor of 2 larger than for super-Earths formed outside the water ice line (r \textbackslash textgreater rH2O) in the water-rich parts of the disc. Additionally, our model shows that the {$\delta$}[Fe/H]/{$\delta$}[C/H] abundance difference in the host star is at least a factor of 3 larger for ice giants formed at r \textbackslash textless rCO compared to ice giants formed far out in the protoplanetary disc (r \textbackslash textgreater rCO). Future observations of wide binary star systems hosting super-Earths and ice giants could therefore help to constrain the migration pathway of these planets and thus constrain planet formation theories.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have found a valley in the size distribution of close-in super-Earths that is interpreted as a signpost that close-in super-Earths are mostly rocky in composition. However, new models predict that planetesimals should first form at the water ice line such that close-in planets are expected to have a significant water ice component. Here we investigate the water contents of super-Earths by studying the interplay between pebble accretion, planet migration and disc evolution. Planets' compositions are determined by their position relative to different condensation fronts (ice lines) throughout their growth. Migration plays a key role. Assuming that planetesimals start at or exterior to the water ice line (r \textbackslash textgreater rH2O), inward migration causes planets to leave the source region of icy pebbles and therefore to have lower final water contents than in discs with either outward migration or no migration. The water ice line itself moves inward as the disc evolves, and delivers water as it sweeps across planets that formed dry. The relative speed and direction of planet migration and inward drift of the water ice line is thus central in determining planets' water contents. If planet formation starts at the water ice line, this implies that hot close-in super-Earths (r \textbackslash textless 0.3 AU) with water contents of a few percent are a signpost of inward planet migration during the early gas phase. Hot super-Earths with larger water ice contents on the other hand, experienced outward migration at the water ice line and only migrated inwards after their formation was complete either because they become too massive to be contained in the region of outward migration or in chains of resonant planets. Measuring the water ice content of hot super-Earths may thus constrain their migration history.},

  abstract = {Observations have revealed that super-Earths (planets up to 10 Earth masses) are the most abundant type of planets in the inner systems. Their formation is strongly linked to the structure of the protoplanetary disc, which determines growth and migration. In the pebble accretion scenario, planets grow to the pebble isolation mass, at which the planet carves a small gap in the gas disc halting the pebble flux and thus its growth. The pebble isolation mass scales with the disc's aspect ratio, which directly depends on the heating source of the protoplanetary disc. I compare the growth of super-Earths in viscously heated discs, where viscous heating dissipates within the first million years, and discs purely heated by the central star with super-Earth observations from the Kepler mission. This allows two formation pathways of super-Earths to be distinguished in the inner systems within this framework. Planets growing within 1 Myr in the viscously heated inner disc reach pebble isolation masses that correspond directly to the inferred masses of the Kepler observations for systems that feature planets in resonance or not in resonance. However, to explain the period ratio distribution of Kepler planets \textendash{} where most Kepler planet pairs are not in mean motion resonance configurations \textendash{} a fraction of these resonant chains has to be broken. In case the planets are born early in a viscously heated disc, these resonant chains thus have to be broken without planetary mergers, for example through the magnetic rebound effect, and the final system architecture should feature low mutual inclinations. If super-Earths form either late or in purely passive discs, the pebble isolation mass is too small (around 2\textendash 3 Earth masses) to explain the Kepler observations, implying that planetary mergers have to play a significant role in determining the final system architecture. Resonant planetary systems thus have to experience mergers already during the gas disc phase, so the planets can get trapped in resonance after reaching 5\textendash 10 Earth masses. In case instabilities are dominating the system architecture, the systems should not be flat, but feature mutually inclined orbits. This implies that future observations of planetary systems with radial velocities (RV) and transits (for example through the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and its follow up RV surveys) could distinguish between these two formation channels of super-Earth and thus constrain planet formation theories.},

  abstract = {Giant planets migrate though the protoplanetary disc as they grow their solid core and attract their gaseous envelope. Previously, we have studied the growth and migration of an isolated planet in an evolving disc. Here, we generalise such models to include the mutual gravitational interaction between a high number of growing planetary bodies. We have investigated how the formation of planetary systems depends on the radial flux of pebbles through the protoplanetary disc and on the planet migration rate. Our N-body simulations confirm previous findings that Jupiter-like planets in orbits outside the water ice line originate from embryos starting out at 20-40 AU when using nominal type-I and type-II migration rates and a pebble flux of approximately 100-200 Earth masses per million years, enough to grow Jupiter within the lifetime of the solar nebula. The planetary embryos placed up to 30 AU migrate into the inner system (rP \textbackslash textless 1AU). There they form super-Earths or hot and warm gas giants, producing systems that are inconsistent with the configuration of the solar system, but consistent with some exoplanetary systems. We also explored slower migration rates which allow the formation of gas giants from embryos originating from the 5-10 AU region, which are stranded exterior to 1 AU at the end of the gas-disc phase. These giant planets can also form in discs with lower pebbles fluxes (50-100 Earth masses per Myr). We identify a pebble flux threshold below which migration dominates and moves the planetary core to the inner disc, where the pebble isolation mass is too low for the planet to accrete gas efficiently. In our model, giant planet growth requires a sufficiently high pebble flux to enable growth to out-compete migration. An even higher pebble flux produces systems with multiple gas giants. We show that planetary embryos starting interior to 5 AU do not grow into gas giants, even if migration is slow and the pebble flux is large. These embryos instead grow to just a few Earth masses, the mass regime of super-Earths. This stunted growth is caused by the low pebble isolation mass in the inner disc and is therefore independent of the pebble flux. Additionally, we show that the long-term evolution of our formed planetary systems can naturally produce systems with inner super-Earths and outer gas giants as well as systems of giant planets on very eccentric orbits.},

  abstract = {Observations of the population of cold Jupiter planets (\$r\textbackslash textgreater\$1 AU) show that nearly all of these planets orbit their host star on eccentric orbits. For planets up to a few Jupiter masses, eccentric orbits are thought to be the outcome of planet-planet scattering events taking place after gas dispersal. We simulate the growth of planets via pebble and gas accretion as well as the migration of multiple planetary embryos in their gas disc. We then follow the long-term dynamical evolution of our formed planetary system up to 100 Myr after gas disc dispersal. We investigate the importance of the initial number of protoplanetary embryos and different damping rates of eccentricity and inclination during the gas phase for the final configuration of our planetary systems. We constrain our model by comparing the final dynamical structure of our simulated planetary systems to that of observed exoplanet systems. Our results show that the initial number of planetary embryos has only a minor impact on the final orbital eccentricity distribution of the giant planets, as long as damping of eccentricity and inclination is efficient. If damping is inefficient (slow), systems with a larger initial number of embryos harbor larger average eccentricities. In addition, for slow damping rates, we observe that scattering events already during the gas disc phase are common and that the giant planets formed in these simulations match the observed giant planet eccentricity distribution best. These simulations also show that massive giant planets (above Jupiter mass) on eccentric orbits are less likely to host inner super-Earths as these get lost during the scattering phase, while systems with less massive giant planets on nearly circular orbits should harbor systems of inner super-Earths. Finally, our simulations predict that giant planets are on average not single, but live in multi-planet systems.},

  abstract = {In the pebble accretion scenario, the pebbles that form planets drift inward from the outer disk regions, carrying water ice with them. At the water ice line, the water ice on the inward drifting pebbles evaporates and is released into the gas phase, resulting in water-rich gas and dry pebbles that move into the inner disk regions. Large planetary cores can block the inward drifting pebbles by forming a pressure bump outside their orbit in the protoplanetary disk. Depending on the relative position of a growing planetary core relative to the water ice line, water-rich pebbles might be blocked outside or inside the water ice line. Pebbles blocked outside the water ice line do not evaporate and thus do not release their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in a dry inner disk, while pebbles blocked outside the water ice line release their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in water vapor diffusing into the inner disk. As a consequence, close-in sub-Neptunes that accrete some gas from the disk should be dry or wet, respectively, if outer gas giants are outside or inside the water ice line, assuming that giant planets form fast, as has been suggested for Jupiter in our Solar System. Alternatively, a sub-Neptune could form outside the water ice line, accreting a large amount of icy pebbles and then migrating inward as a very wet sub-Neptune. We suggest that the water content of inner sub-Neptunes in systems with giant planets that can efficiently block the inward drifting pebbles could constrain the formation conditions of these systems, thus making these sub-Neptunes exciting targets for detailed characterization (e.g., with JWST, ELT, or ARIEL). In addition, the search for giant planets in systems with already characterized sub-Neptunes can be used to constrain the formation conditions of giant planets as well.},

  year = {2021},
  pages = {1--12},
  abstract = {A crucial phase during planetary growth is the migration when the planetary core has been assembled, but the planet did not open a deep gap yet. During this phase the planet is subject to fast type-I migration, which is mostly directed inwards, and the planet can lose a significant fraction of its semi-major axis. The duration of this phase is set by how long the planetary envelope needs to contract until it reaches a mass similar to the mass of the planetary core, which is when runaway gas accretion can set in and the planet can open a deeper gap in the disc, transitioning into the slower type-II migration. This envelope contraction phase depends crucially on the planetary mass and on the opacity inside the planetary envelope. Here we study how different opacity prescriptions influence the envelope contraction time and how this in turn influences how far the planet migrates through the disc. We find within our simulations that the size distribution of the grains as well as the chemical composition of the grains crucially influences how far the planet migrates before it can reach the runaway gas accretion phase. Grain size distributions with larger grain sizes result in less inward migration of the growing planet, due to faster gas accretion enabled by more efficient cooling. In addition, we find that planets forming in water poor environments can contract their envelope faster and thus migrate less, implying that gas giants forming in water poor environments might be located further away from their central star compared to gas giants forming in water rich environments. Future studies of planet formation that aim to investigate the chemical composition of formed gas giants need to take these effects self consistently into account.},

To maximize the efficiency of follow-up observations, a prioritization scheme must be developed to determine which planets are most likely to be EECs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for estimating the likelihood that any directly imaged extrasolar planet is a true exo-Earth candidate by interpreting the planet's apparent magnitude and separation in light of existing exoplanet statistics. As a specific application of this general framework, we use published estimates of the discovery yield of future space-based direct imaging mission concepts to conduct "mock surveys" in which we compute the likelihood that each detected planet is an EEC. We find that it will be difficult to determine which planets are EECs with \$\textbackslash textgreater50\textbackslash backslash\%\$ confidence using single-band photometry immediately upon their detection. The best way to reduce this ambiguity would be to constrain the planet's orbit by revisiting the system multiple times or through a radial velocity precursor survey. Astrometric or radial velocity constraints on the planet's mass would offer a lesser benefit. Finally, we show that a Bayesian approach to prioritizing targets would improve the follow-up efficiency of a direct imaging survey versus a blind approach using the same data. For example, the prioritized approach could reduce the amount of integration time required for the spectral detection (or rejection) of water absorption in most EECs by a factor of two.},

  abstract = {Life has had a dramatic impact on the composition of Earth's atmosphere over time, which suggests that statistical studies of other inhabited planets' atmospheres could reveal how they co-evolve with life. While many evolutionary pathways are possible for inhabited worlds, a possible starting hypothesis is that most of them evolve similarly to Earth, which we propose could lead to a positive "age-oxygen correlation" between the ages of inhabited planets and the fraction which have oxygen-rich atmospheres. We demonstrate that next-generation space observatories currently under consideration could test this hypothesis, but only if the stellar age distribution of the target sample is carefully considered. We explore three possible parameterizations of the age-oxygen correlation, finding that they yield similar results. Finally, we examine how abiotic oxygen sources could affect the results, and discuss how measuring the age-dependence of oxygen could shed light on whether it is a reliable biosignature. Future efforts can expand upon this groundwork by incorporating detailed models of the redox balance of terrestrial planets and its dependence on stellar and planetary properties.},

  abstract = {Next-generation space observatories will conduct the first systematic surveys of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres and search for evidence of life beyond Earth. While in-depth observations of the nearest habitable worlds may yield enticing results, there are fundamental questions about planetary habitability and evolution which can only be answered through population-level studies of dozens to hundreds of terrestrial planets. To determine the requirements for next-generation observatories to address these questions, we have developed Bioverse. Bioverse combines existing knowledge of exoplanet statistics with a survey simulation and hypothesis testing framework to determine whether proposed space-based direct imaging and transit spectroscopy surveys will be capable of detecting various hypothetical statistical relationships between the properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Following a description of the code, we apply Bioverse to determine whether an ambitious direct imaging or transit survey would be able to determine the extent of the circumstellar habitable zone and study the evolution of Earth-like planets. Given recent evidence that Earth-sized habitable zone planets are likely much rarer than previously believed (Pascucci et al. 2019), we find that space missions with large search volumes will be necessary to study the population of terrestrial and habitable worlds. Moving forward, Bioverse provides a methodology for performing trade studies of future observatory concepts to maximize their ability to address population-level questions, including and beyond the specific examples explored here.},

  abstract = {We report the confirmation of a transiting planet around the bright, inactive M0.5 V star TOI-1235 (TYC 4384-1735-1, V = 11.5 mag), whose transit signal was detected in the photometric time series of Sectors 14, 20, and 21 of the TESS space mission. We confirm the planetary nature of the transit signal, which has a period of 3.44 d, by using precise radial velocity measurements with CARMENES and HARPS-N spectrographs. A comparison of the properties derived for TOI-1235 b's with theoretical models reveals that the planet has a rocky composition, with a bulk density slightly higher than Earth's. In particular, we measure a mass of M\_p = 5.9+/-0.6 M\_Earth and a radius of R\_p = 1.69+/-0.08 R\_Earth, which together result in a density of rho\_p = 6.7+1.3-1.1 g/cm3. When compared with other well-characterized exoplanetary systems, the particular combination of planetary radius and mass puts our discovery in the radius gap, a transition region between rocky planets and planets with significant atmospheric envelopes, with few known members. While the exact location of the radius gap for M dwarfs is still a matter of debate, our results constrain it to be located at around 1.7 R\_Earth or larger at the insolation levels received by TOI-1235 b ({$\sim$}60 S\_Earth), which makes it an extremely interesting object for further studies of planet formation and atmospheric evolution.},

  abstract = {Context. Planet formation is expected to take place in the first million years of a planetary system through various processes, which remain to be tested through observations. Aims. With the recent discovery, using ALMA, of two gaseous spiral arms inside the 120 au cavity and connected to dusty spirals, the famous protoplanetary disk around AB Aurigae presents a strong incentive for investigating the mechanisms that lead to giant planet formation. A candidate protoplanet located inside a spiral arm has already been claimed in an earlier study based on the same ALMA data. Methods. We used SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to perform near-infrared (IR) high-contrast imaging of AB Aur in polarized and unpolarized light in order to study the morphology of the disk and search for signs of planet formation. Results. SPHERE has delivered the deepest images ever obtained for AB Aur in scattered light. Among the many structures that are yet to be understood, we identified not only the inner spiral arms, but we also resolved a feature in the form of a twist in the eastern spiral at a separation of about 30 au. The twist of the spiral is perfectly reproduced with a planet-driven density wave model when projection effects are accounted for. We measured an azimuthal displacement with respect to the counterpart of this feature in the ALMA data, which is consistent with Keplerian motion on a 4-yr baseline. Another point sxce is detected near the edge of the inner ring, which is likely the result of scattering as opposed to the direct emission from a planet photosphere. We tentatively derived mass constraints for these two features. Conclusions. The twist and its apparent orbital motion could well be the first direct evidence of a connection between a protoplanet candidate and its manifestation as a spiral imprinted in the gas and dust distributions.},

The evolution passes through the following phases. (1) Planetesimals accrete to form a core of rocky and icy material. (2) When the core mass has grown to a few tenths of an Earth mass, a gaseous envelope in hydrostatic equilibrium begins to form around the core. (3) The core and envelope continue to grow until the "critical" core mass is reached, beyond which point the envelope increases in mass much more rapidly than the core. (4) The envelope mass increases quickly to its present value and prodices a relatively high luminosity, derived from gravitational contraction. (5) Accretion of both core and envelope terminates, and the planet contracts and cools to its present state on a time scale of 5 \texttimes{} 109 years. Evolutionary calculations of phases (2) through (5) are presented, based on solutions of the time-dependent stellar structure equations in spherical symmetry. The physical considerations that determine the critical core mass are discussed; its value is found to depend strongly on the core accretion rate but only weakly on surface boundary conditions. Evolutionary tracks up to the present state are presented for objects of Uranus and Saturn mass. \textcopyright{} 1986.},

  abstract = {Nearby stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches and characterization using a variety of detection techniques. Combining constraints from the complementary detection methods of high contrast imaging (HCI) and radial velocity (RV) can further constrain the planetary architectures of these systems because these methods place limits at different regions of the companion mass and semi-major axis parameter space. We aim to constrain the planetary architectures from the combination of HCI and RV data for 6 nearby stars within 6 pc: \$\textbackslash backslashtau\$ Ceti, Kapteyn's star, AX Mic, 40 Eri, HD 36395, and HD 42581. We compiled the sample from stars with available archival VLT/NACO HCI data at L\$\^\{\textbackslash backslashprime\}\$ band (3.8 \$\textbackslash backslashmu\$m). The NACO data were fully reanalyzed using the state-of-the-art direct imaging pipeline PynPoint and combined with RV data from HARPS, Keck/HIRES, and CORALIE. A Monte Carlo approach was used to assess the completeness in the companion mass/semi-major axis parameter space from the combination of the HCI and RV data sets. We find that the HCI data add significant information to the RV constraints, increasing the completeness for certain companions masses/semi-major axes by up to 68 - 99\% for 4 of the 6 stars in our sample, and by up to 1 - 13\% for the remaining stars. The improvements are strongest for intermediate semi-major axes (15 - 40 AU), corresponding to the semi-major axes of the ice giants in our own solar system. The HCI mass limits reach 5 - 20 \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashtextrm\{Jup\}\}\$ in the background-limited regime, depending on the age of the star. Through the combination of HCI and RV data, we find that stringent constraints can be placed on the possible substellar companions in these systems. Applying these methods systematically to nearby stars will quantify our current knowledge of the planet population in the solar neighborhood and inform future observations.},

  abstract = {Transit Timing Variations, or TTVs, can be a very efficient way of constraining masses and eccentricities of multi-planet systems. Recent measurements of the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1 led to an estimate of the masses of the planets, enabling an estimate of their densities. A recent TTV analysis using data obtained in the past two years yields a 34\% and 13\% increase in mass for TRAPPIST-1b and c, respectively. In most studies to date, a Newtonian N-body model is used to fit the masses of the planets, while sometimes general relativity is accounted for. Using the Posidonius N-body code, we show that in the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, non-Newtonian effects might be also relevant to correctly model the dynamics of the system and the resulting TTVs. In particular, using standard values of the tidal Love number \$k\_2\$ (accounting for the tidal deformation) and the fluid Love number \$k\_\{2f\}\$ (accounting for the rotational flattening) leads to differences in the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1b and c similar to the differences caused by general relativity. We also show that relaxing the values of tidal Love number \$k\_2\$ and the fluid Love number \$k\_\{2f\}\$ can lead to TTVs which differ by as much as a few 10{$\sim$}s on a \$3-4\$-year timescale, which is a potentially observable level. The high values of the Love numbers needed to reach observable levels for the TTVs could be achieved for planets with a liquid ocean, which, if detected, might then be interpreted as a sign that TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c could have a liquid magma ocean. For TRAPPIST-1 and similar systems, the models to fit the TTVs should potentially account for general relativity, for the tidal deformation of the planets, for the rotational deformation of the planets and, to a lesser extent, for the rotational deformation of the star, which would add up to 7x2+1 = 15 additional free parameters in the case of TRAPPIST-1.},

  abstract = {The habitable zone is the region around a star where standing bodies of liquid water can be stable on a planetary surface. Its width is often assumed to be dictated by the efficiency of the carbonate-silicate cycle, which has maintained habitable surface conditions on our planet for billions of years. This cycle may be inhibited by surface condensation of significant amounts of \$CO\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{2\}\}\$ ice, which is likely to occur on distant planets containing high enough levels of atmospheric \$CO\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{2\}\}\$. Such a process could permanently trap \$CO\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{2\}\}\$ ice within the planet, threatening its long-term habitability. Recent work has modeled this scenario for initially cold and icy planetary bodies orbiting the Sun. Here, we use an advanced energy balance model to consider both initially warm and cold rapidly-rotating planets orbiting F - K stars. We show that the range of orbital distances where significant surface \$CO\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{2\}\}\$ ice condensation occurs is significantly reduced for warm start planets. Star type does not affect this conclusion, although surface \$CO\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{2\}\}\$ ice condenses over a larger fraction of the habitable zone around hotter stars. The warm start simulations are thus consistent with 1-D model predictions, suggesting that the classical habitable zone limits in those earlier models are still valid. We also find that the cold start simulations exhibit trends that are consistent with those of previous work for the Sun although we now extend the analysis to other star types.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary discs around brown dwarfs and very low mass stars offer some of the best prospects for forming Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones. To this end, we study the nature of the disc around the very low mass star V410 X-ray 1, whose SED is indicative of an optically thick and very truncated dust disc, with our modelling suggesting an outer radius of only 0.6 au. We investigate two scenarios that could lead to such a truncation, and find that the observed SED is compatible with both. The first scenario involves the truncation of both the dust and gas in the disc, perhaps due to a previous dynamical interaction or the presence of an undetected companion. The second scenario involves the fact that a radial location of 0.6 au is close to the expected location of the H 2 O snowline in the disc. As such, a combination of efficient dust growth, radial migration, and subsequent fragmentation within the snowline leads to an optically thick inner dust disc and larger, optically thin outer dust disc. We find that a firm measurement of the CO J = 2\textendash 1 line flux would enable us to distinguish between these two scenarios, by enabling a measurement of the radial extent of gas in the disc. Many models we consider contain at least several Earth-masses of dust interior to 0.6 au, suggesting that V410 X-ray 1 could be a precursor to a system with tightly-packed inner planets, such as TRAPPIST-1.},

  abstract = {We carried out a Bayesian homogeneous determination of the orbital parameters of 231 transiting giant planets (TGPs) that are alone or have distant companions; we employed differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to analyse radial-velocity (RV) data from the literature and 782 new high-accuracy RVs obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph for 45 systems over {$\sim$}3 years. Our work yields the largest sample of systems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital, planetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs in non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their host stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital separations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide theory. This feature would be the outcome of planetary migration from highly eccentric orbits excited by planet-planet scattering, Kozai-Lidov perturbations, or secular chaos. The distribution of {$\alpha$} = a/aR, where a and aR are the semi-major axis and the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this agrees with expectations from the high-eccentricity migration (HEM), although it might not be limited to this migration scenario. The few planets of our sample with circular orbits and {$\alpha\backslash$}textgreater 5 values may have migrated through disc-planet interactions instead of HEM. By comparing circularisation times with stellar ages, we found that hot Jupiters with a5 {$\lessequivlnt$} Q'p {$\lessequivlnt$} 109, and that stellar Q's {$\greaterequivlnt$} 106 - 107 are required to explain the presence of eccentric planets at the same orbital distance. As aby-product of our analysis, we detected a non-zero eccentricity e = 0.104-0.018+0.021 for HAT-P-29; we determined that five planets that were previously regarded to be eccentric or to have hints of non-zero eccentricity, namely CoRoT-2b, CoRoT-23b, TrES-3b, HAT-P-23b, and WASP-54b, have circular orbits or undetermined eccentricities; we unveiled curvatures caused by distant companions in the RV time series of HAT-P-2, HAT-P-22, and HAT-P-29; we significantly improved the orbital parameters of the long-period planet HAT-P-17c; and we revised the planetary parameters of CoRoT-1b, which turned out to be considerably more inflated than previously found.},

  abstract = {Planets and stars ultimately form out of the collapse of the same cloud of gas. Whilst planets, and planetary bodies, readily loose volatiles, a common hypothesis is that they retain the same refractory composition as their host star. This is true within the Solar System. The refractory composition of chondritic meteorites, Earth and other rocky planetary bodies are consistent with solar, within the observational errors. This work aims to investigate whether this hypothesis holds for exoplanetary systems. If true, the internal structure of observed rocky exoplanets can be better constrained using their host star abundances. In this paper, we analyse the abundances of the K-dwarf, G200-39, and compare them to its polluted white dwarf companion, WD 1425+540. The white dwarf has accreted planetary material, most probably a Kuiper belt-like object, from an outer planetary system surviving the star's evolution to the white dwarf phase. Given that binary pairs are chemically homogeneous, we use the binary companion, G200-39, as a proxy for the composition of the progenitor to WD 1425+540. We show that the elemental abundances of the companion star and the planetary material accreted by WD 1425+540 are consistent with the hypothesis that planet and host-stars have the same true abundances, taking into account the observational errors.},

  abstract = {The photometric method detects planets orbiting other stars by searching for the reduction in the light flux or the change in the color of the stellar flux that occurs when a planet transits a star. A transit by Jupiter or Saturn would reduce the stellar flux by approximately 1\% while a transit by Uranus or Neptune would reduce the stellar flux by 0.1\%. A highly characteristic color change with an amplitude approximately 0.1 of that for the flux reduction would also accompany the transit and could be used to verify that the source of the flux reduction was a planetary transit rather than some other phenomenon. Although the precision required to detect major planets is already available with state-of-the-art photometers, the detection of terrestrial-sized planets would require a precision substantially greater than the state-of-the-art and a spaceborne platform to avoid the effects of variations in sky transparency and scintillation. Because the probability is so small of observing a planetary transit during a single observation of a randomly chosen star, the search program must be designed to continuously monitor hundreds or thousands of stars. The most promising approach is to search for large planets with a photometric system that has a single-measurement precision of 0.1\%. If it is assumed that large planets will have long-period orbits, and that each star has an average of one large planet, then approximately 104 stars must be monitored continuously. To monitor such a large groups of stars simultaneously while maintaining the required photometric precision, a detector array coupled by a fiber-optic bundle to the focal plane of a moderate aperture ({$\approx$} 1 m), wide field of view ({$\approx$}50\textdegree ) telescope is required. Based on the stated assumptions, a detection rate of one planet per year of observation appears possible. \textcopyright{} 1984.},

The core of Jupiter, as well as the cores of close-in gas giants are therefore thought to form in this region of the disk. Nevertheless, constraining the formation location of individual planets has proven to be difficult. Aims. We aim to use the nitrogen abundance in Jupiter, which is around four times solar, in combination with Juno constraints on the total mass of heavy elements in Jupiter to narrow down its formation scenario. Methods. Different pathways of enrichment of the atmosphere of Jupiter are considered, such as the accretion of enriched gas, pebbles, and planetesimals, and their implications for the oxygen abundance of Jupiter are discussed. Results. The super-solar nitrogen abundance in Jupiter necessitates the accretion of extra N 2 from the proto-solar nebula. The only location of the disk where this can happen is outside or just inside the N 2 ice line. These constraints favor a pebble accretion origin of Jupiter, from the perspective of composition and planet formation. We predict that Jupiter's oxygen abundance is between 3.6 and 4.5 times solar.},

  abstract = {Wide-field surveys for transiting planets, such as the NASA Kepler and TESS missions, are usually conducted without knowing which stars have binary companions. Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors in planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and mistakes in completeness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs, making it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates. Here we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try and clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate density measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The formula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary stars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and single stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries are over-represented in flux-limited samples. Application of the formula to an idealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 \$R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, the net systematic error is of order 5\%. In particular, unrecognized binaries are unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot Jupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys. For smaller planets the errors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be overestimated by as much as 50\%. We also show that whenever high-resolution imaging reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more likely to orbit the primary star than the secondary star.},

The accretion-ejection connection takes place at least in part in this compact magnetized region around the central star, with the inner disk edge interacting with the star's magnetosphere thus leading simultaneously to magnetically channeled accretion flows and to high velocity winds and outflows. The magnetic star-disk interaction is thought to have strong implications for the angular momentum evolution of the central system, the inner structure of the disk, and possibly for halting the migration of young planets close to the stellar surface. We review here the current status of magnetic field measurements in T Tauri stars, the recent modeling efforts of the magnetospheric accretion process, including both radiative transfer and multi-D numerical simulations, and summarize current evidence supporting the concept of magnetically-channeled accretion in young stars. We also discuss the limits of the models and highlight observational results which suggest that the star-disk interaction is a highly dynamical and time variable process in young stars.},

  abstract = {The orbital eccentricities of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarf companions provide clues about their formation and dynamical histories. We combine new high-contrast imaging observations of substellar companions obtained primarily with Keck/NIRC2 together with astrometry from the literature to test for differences in the population-level eccentricity distributions of 27 long-period giant planets and brown dwarf companions between 5-100 AU using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Orbit fits are performed in a uniform manner for companions with short orbital arcs; this typically results in broad constraints for individual eccentricity distributions, but together as an ensemble these systems provide valuable insight into their collective underlying orbital patterns. The shape of the eccentricity distribution function for our full sample of substellar companions is approximately flat from e=0-1. When subdivided by companion mass and mass ratio, the underlying distributions for giant planets and brown dwarfs show significant differences. Low mass ratio companions preferentially have low eccentricities, similar to the orbital properties of warm Jupiters found with radial velocities and transits. We interpret this as evidence for in situ formation on largely undisturbed orbits within massive, extended disks. Brown dwarf companions exhibit a broad peak at e \$\textbackslash backslashapprox\$ 0.6-0.9 with evidence for a dependence on orbital period. This closely resembles the orbital properties and period-eccentricity trends of wide (1-200 AU) stellar binaries, suggesting that brown dwarfs in this separation range predominantly form in a similar fashion. We also report evidence that the "eccentricity dichotomy" observed at small separations extends to planets on wide orbits: the mean eccentricity for the multi-planet system HR 8799 is lower than for systems with single planets.

Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.}

The covariances between the parameters are also estimated in the process. ZASPE can in principle use any pre-calculated grid of synthetic spectra, but unbiased grids are required to obtain accurate parameters. We tested the performance of two existing libraries, and we concluded that neither is suitable for computing precise atmospheric parameters. We describe a process to synthesize a new library of synthetic spectra that was found to generate consistent results when compared with parameters obtained with different methods (interferometry, asteroseismology, equivalent widths).},

We compare the relative occurrence of these two architectures as a fraction of detected planetary systems to determine the role that metallicity plays in planet formation. We show that compact multi-planet systems occur more frequently around stars of increasingly lower metallicities using spectroscopically derived abundances for more than 700 planet hosts. At higher metallicities, compact multi-planet systems comprise a nearly constant fraction of the planet hosts despite the steep rise in the fraction of hosts containing hot and cool-Jupiters. Since metal poor stars have been underrepresented in planet searches, this implies that the occurrence rate of compact multis is higher than previously reported. Due to observational limits, radial velocity planet searches have focused mainly on high-metallicity stars where they have a higher chance of finding giant planets. New extreme-precision radial velocity instruments coming online that can detect these compact multi-planet systems can target lower metallicity stars to find them.},

  abstract = {Aims. We describe the growth of gas giant planets in the core accretion scenario. The core growth is not modeled as a gradual accretion of planetesimals but as episodic impacts of large mass ratios, i.e. we study impacts of 0.02-1 M {$\oplus$} onto cores of 1-15 M {$\oplus$}. Such impacts could deliver the majority of solid matter in the giant impact regime. We focus on the thermal response of the envelope to the energy delivery. Previous studies have shown that sudden shut off of core accretion can dramatically speed up gas accretion. We therefore expect that giant impacts followed by periods of very low core accretion will result in a net increase in gas accretion rate. This study aims at modelling such a sequence of events and to understand the reaction of the envelope to giant impacts in more detail. Methods. To model this scenario, we spread the impact energy deposition over a time that is long compared to the sound crossing time, but very short compared to the Kelvin-Helmholtz time. The simulations are done in spherical symmetry and assume quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium. Results. Results confirm what could be inferred from previous studies: gas can be accreted faster onto the core for the same net core growth speed while at the same time rapid gas accretion can occur for smaller cores-significantly smaller than the usual critical core mass. Furthermore our simulations show, that significant mass fractions of the envelope can be ejected by such an impact. Conclusions. Large impacts are an efficient process to remove the accretion energy by envelope ejection. In the time between impacts, very fast gas accretion can take place. This process could significantly shorten the formation time of gas giant planets. As an important side-effect, the episodic ejection of the envelope will reset the envelope composition to nebula conditions. \textcopyright{} 2012 ESO.},

In this scenario, planets grow by accreting cm-to-m-sized pebbles instead of km-sized planetesimals. One of the main differences with planetesimal-driven core accretion is the increased thermal ablation experienced by pebbles. This can provide early enrichment to the planet's envelope, which changes the process of core growth. Aims: We aim to predict core masses and envelope compositions of planets that form by pebble accretion and compare mass deposition of pebbles to planetesimals. Methods: We model the early growth of a proto-planet by calculating the structure of its envelope, taking into account the fate of impacting pebbles or planetesimals. The region where high-Z material can exist in vapor form is determined by the vapor pressure. We include enrichment effects by locally modifying the mean molecular weight of the envelope. Results: In the pebble case, three phases of core growth can be identified. In the first phase, pebbles impact the core without significant ablation. During the second phase, ablation becomes increasingly severe. A layer of high-Z vapor starts to form around the core that absorbs a small fraction of the ablated mass. The rest either rains out to the core or mixes outwards instead, slowing core growth. In the third phase, the high-Z inner region expands outwards, absorbing an increasing fraction of the ablated material as vapor. Rainout ends before the core mass reaches 0.6 M\_Earth, terminating direct core growth. In the case of icy H2O pebbles, this happens before 0.1 M\_Earth. Conclusions: Our results indicate that pebble accretion can directly form rocky cores up to only 0.6 M\_Earth, and is unable to form similarly sized icy cores. Subsequent core growth can proceed indirectly when the planet cools, provided it is able to retain its high-Z material.},

  abstract = {Context. In recent years, protoplanetary disks with spiral structures have been detected in scattered light, millimeter continuum, and CO gas emission. The mechanisms causing these structures are still under debate. A popular scenario to drive the spiral arms is the one of a planet perturbing the material in the disk. However, if the disk is massive, gravitational instability isusually the favored explanation. Multiwavelength studies could be helpful to distinguish between the two scenarios. So far, only a handful of disks with spiral arms have been observed in both scattered light and millimeter continuum. Aims. We aim to perform an in-depth characterization of the protoplanetary disk morphology around WaOph 6 analyzing data obtained at different wavelengths, as well as to investigate the origin of the spiral features in the disk. Methods. We present the first near-infrared polarimetric observations of WaOph 6 obtained with SPHERE at the VLT and compare them to archival millimeter continuum ALMA observations. We traced the spiral features in both data sets and estimated the respective pitch angles. We discuss the different scenarios that can give rise to the spiral arms in WaOph 6. We tested the planetary perturber hypothesis by performing hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations to compare them with scattered light and millimeter continuum observations. Results. We confirm that the spiral structure is present in our polarized scattered light H -band observationsof WaOph 6, making it the youngest disk with spiral arms detected at these wavelengths. From the comparison to the millimeter ALMA-DSHARP observations, we confirm that the disk is flared. We explore the possibility of a massive planetary perturber driving the spiral arms by running hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations, and we find that a planet of minimum 10 M Jup outside of the observed spiral structure is able to drive spiral arms that resemble the ones in the observations. We derive detection limits from our SPHERE observations and get estimates of the planet's contrast from different evolutionary models. Conclusions. Up to now, no spiral arms had been observed in scattered light in disks around K and/or M stars with ages \textbackslash textless1 Myr. Future observations of WaOph 6 could allow us to test theoretical predictions for planet evolutionary models, as well as give us more insightinto the mechanisms driving the spiral arms.},

To this end, LCOGT is constructing a world-wide network of telescopes, including the two 2m Faulkes telescopes, as many as 17 x 1m telescopes, and as many as 23 x 40cm telescopes. These telescopes initially will be outfitted for imaging and (excepting the 40cm telescopes) spectroscopy at wavelengths between the atmospheric UV cutoff and the roughly 1-micron limit of silicon detectors. Since the first of LCOGT's 1m telescopes are now being deployed, we lay out here LCOGT's scientific goals and the requirements that these goals place on network architecture and performance, we summarize the network's present and projected level of development, and we describe our expected schedule for completing it. In the bulk of the paper, we describe in detail the technical approaches that we have adopted to attain the desired performance. In particular, we discuss our choices for the number and location of network sites, for the number and sizes of telescopes, for the specifications of the first generation of instruments, for the software that will schedule and control the network's telescopes and reduce and archive its data, and for the structure of the scientific and educational programs for which the network will provide observations.},

  abstract = {Context. In the core accretion scenario of giant planet formation, a massive core forms first and then accretes a gaseous envelope. In the discussion of how this core forms, some divergences appear. The first scenarios of planet formation predict the accretion of kilometre-sized bodies called planetesimals, while more recent works suggest growth by the accretion of pebbles, which are centimetre-sized objects. Aims. These two accretion models are often discussed separately and our aim here is to compare the outcomes of the two models with identical initial conditions. Methods. The comparison is done using two distinct codes, one that computes the planetesimal accretion and the other the pebble accretion. All the other components of the simulated planet growth are computed identically in the two models: the disc, the accretion of gas, and the migration. Using a population synthesis approach, we compare planet simulations and study the impact of the two solid accretion models, focusing on the formation of single planets. Results. We find that the outcomes of the populations are strongly influenced by the accretion model. The planetesimal model predicts the formation of more giant planets, while the pebble accretion model forms more super-Earth-mass planets. This is due to the pebble isolation mass (Miso) concept, which prevents planets formed by pebble accretion to accrete gas efficiently before reaching Miso. This translates into a population of planets that are not heavy enough to accrete a consequent envelope, but that are in a mass range where type I migration is very efficient. We also find higher gas mass fractions for a given core mass for the pebble model compared to the planetesimal model, caused by luminosity differences. This also implies planets with lower densities, which could be confirmed observationally. Conclusions. We conclude that the two models produce different outputs. Focusing on giant planets, the sensitivity of their formation differs: for the pebble accretion model, the time at which the embryos are formed and the period over which solids are accreted strongly impact the results, while the population of giant planets formed by planetesimal accretion depends on the planetesimal size and on the splitting in the amount of solids available to form planetesimals.},

Our survey is sensitive to Jupiter mass planets out to 20 AU for a majority of stars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period planets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends indicating the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 AU. We combine our RV observations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and orbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our sensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total occurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 +/- 5\% over the range 1 - 20 M\_Jup and 5 - 20 AU. Our data also suggest a declining frequency for gas giant planets in these systems beyond 3-10 AU, in contrast to earlier studies that found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01-3 AU. This suggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3-10 AU, or that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis distribution than the overall gas giant planet population. Our results also suggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than cold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher average eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that dynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these systems.},

We consistently re-fit all published radial velocity datasets for a sample of 65 stars and find 9 systems with statistically significant trends indicating the presence of an outer companion. We combine these radial velocity data with AO images in order to constrain the allowed masses and semi-major axes of these companions. We quantify our sensitivity to the presence of long period companions by fitting the sample with a power law distribution and find an estimated occurrence rate of 39+/-7\% for companions between 0.5-20 M\_Jup and 1-20 AU. Half of our systems were discovered by the transit method and the other half were discovered by the RV method. While differences in RV baselines and number of data points between the two samples lead to different sensitivities to distant companions, we find that the occurrence rates of gas giant companions in each sample is consistent at the 0.5sigma level. We compare the frequency of Jupiter analogs in these systems to the equivalent rate from field star surveys and find that Jupiter analogs are more common around stars hosting super-Earths. We conclude that the presence of outer gas giant planets does not suppress the formation of inner super-Earths, and that these two populations of planets instead appear to be correlated with each other. We also find that the stellar metallicities of systems with gas giant companions are significantly higher than those without companions, in good agreement with the well-established metallicity correlation from RV surveys of field stars.},

  abstract = {The Kepler DR25 planet candidate catalog was produced using an automated method of planet candidate identification based on various tests. These tests were tuned to obtain a reasonable but arbitrary balance between catalog completeness and reliability. We produce new catalogs with differing balances of completeness and reliability by varying these tests, and study the impact of these alternative catalogs on occurrence rates. We find that if there is no correction for reliability, different catalogs give statistically inconsistent occurrence rates, while if we correct for both completeness and reliability, we get statistically consistent occurrence rates. This is a strong indication that correction for completeness and reliability is critical for the accurate computation of occurrence rates. Additionally, we find that this result is the same whether using Bayesian Poisson likelihood MCMC or Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We also examine the use of a Robovetter disposition score cut as an alternative to reliability correction, and find that while a score cut does increase the reliability of the catalog, it is not as accurate as performing a full reliability correction. We get the same result when performing a reliability correction with and without a score cut. Therefore removing low-score planets removes data without providing any advantage, and should be avoided when possible. We make our alternative catalogs publicly available, and propose that these should be used as a test of occurrence rate methods, with the requirement that a method should provide statistically consistent occurrence rates for all these catalogs.},

  abstract = {Exoplanet catalogs produced by surveys suffer from a lack of completeness (not every planet is detected) and less than perfect reliability (not every planet in the catalog is a true planet), particularly near the survey's detection limit. Exoplanet occurrence rate studies based on such a catalog must be corrected for completeness and reliability. The final Kepler data release, DR25, features a uniformly vetted planet candidate catalog and data products that facilitate corrections. We present a new probabilistic approach to the characterization of Kepler completeness and reliability, making full use of the Kepler DR25 products. We illustrate the impact of completeness and reliability corrections with a Poisson-likelihood occurrence rate method, using a recent stellar properties catalog that incorporates Gaia stellar radii and essentially uniform treatment of the stellar population. Correcting for reliability has a significant impact: the exoplanet occurrence rate for orbital period and radius within 20\% of Earth's around GK dwarf stars, corrected for reliability, is 0.015+0.011-0.007, whereas not correcting results in 0.034+0.018-0.012 - correcting for reliability reduces this occurrence rate by more than a factor of two. We further show that using Gaia-based vs. DR25 stellar properties impacts the same occurrence rate by a factor of two. We critically examine the the DR25 catalog and the assumptions behind our occurrence rate method. We propose several ways in which confidence in both the Kepler catalog and occurrence rate calculations can be improved. This work provides an example of how the community can use the DR25 completeness and reliability products.},

We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define {$\eta\oplus$} as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that {$\eta\oplus$} for the conservative HZ is between (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between and planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is {$\sim$}6 pc away and there are {$\sim$}4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

Despite their sheer abundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. The available evidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rocky planets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thick hydrogen and helium gas envelopes. Here we report the metallicities (that is, the abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanet candidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into three populations defined by statistically distinct ({$\sim$}4.5{$\sigma$}) metallicity regions. We interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes of terrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 Earth radii), gas dwarf planets with rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 Earth radii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 Earth radii). These transitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates, implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solids inventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating the structure of planetary systems. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Whereas hot-Jupiter type exoplanets preferentially form around metal-rich stars, the conditions required for the formation of planets with masses, orbits and eccentricities comparable to Jupiter (Jupiter analogues) are unknown. Using spectroscopic metallicities, we show that stars hosting Jupiter analogues have an average metallicity close to solar, in contrast to their hot-Jupiter and eccentric cool Jupiter counterparts, which orbit stars with super-solar metallicities. Furthermore, the eccentricities of Jupiter analogues increase with host star metallicity, suggesting that planet-planet scatterings producing highly eccentric cool Jupiters could be more common in metal-rich environments. To investigate a possible explanation for these metallicity trends, we compare the observations to numerical simulations, which indicate that metal-rich stars typically form multiple Jupiters, leading to planet-planet interactions and, hence, a prevalence of either eccentric cool Jupiters or hot-Jupiters with circularized orbits. Although the samples are small and exhibit variations in their metallicities, suggesting that numerous processes other than metallicity affect the formation of planetary systems, the data in hand suggests that Jupiter analogues and terrestrial-sized planets form around stars with average metallicities close to solar, whereas high metallicity systems preferentially host eccentric cool Jupiter or hot-Jupiters, indicating higher metallicity systems may not be favorable for the formation of planetary systems akin to the Solar System.},

Active galactic nuclei are known to have complex X-ray spectra that depend on both the properties of the accreting super-massive black hole (e.g. mass, accretion rate) and the distribution of obscuring material in its vicinity (i.e. the "torus"). Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies. Methods. We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides a better representation of the observations. This methodology is applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South. Results. For the {$\sim$}350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra: (1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection, most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence (B \textbackslash textgreater 100). We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results in underestimation of the inferred column density, NH, of the obscurer. Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open (e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry in favour of an intermediate case. Conclusions. Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally, we release a catalogue of AGN in the CDFS with estimated parameters such as the accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV band and the column density, NH, of the obscurer. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2014.},

Future surveys for extrasolar planets using the transit technique will also have sensitivity to detect these longer period planets. Orbital eccentricity affects the detection of extrasolar planets using the transit technique in two opposing ways: an enhancement in the probability for the planet to transit near pericenter and a reduction in the detectability of the transit due to a shorter transit duration. For an eccentricity distribution matching the currently known extrasolar planets with P\textbackslash textgreater10 day, the probability for the planet to transit is {$\sim$}1.25 times higher than the equivalent circular orbit and the average transit duration is {$\sim$}0.88 times shorter than the equivalent circular orbit. These two opposing effects nearly cancel for an idealized field transit survey with independent photometric measurements that are dominated by Poisson noise. The net effect is a modest {$\sim$}4\% increase in the transiting planet yield compared to assuming all planets have circular orbits. When intrinsic variability of the star or correlated photometric measurements are the dominant source of noise, the transit detectability is independent of the transit duration. In this case the transit yield is {$\sim$}25\% higher than that predicted under the assumption of circular orbits. Since the Kepler search for Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of a Solar-type star is limited by intrinsic variability, the Kepler mission is expected to have a {$\sim$}25\% higher planet yield than that predicted for circular orbits if the Earth-sized planets have an orbital eccentricity distribution similar to the currently known Jupiter-mass planets.},

This study examines planet occurrence rates for the Kepler GK dwarf target sample for planet radii, 2.5 , and orbital periods, 300 days, with an emphasis on a thorough exploration and identification of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties. Integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of F0 = 0.77 planets per star, with an allowed range of 1.9. The allowed range takes into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of F0 beyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis. We generally find higher planet occurrence rates and a steeper increase in planet occurrence rates toward small planets than previous studies of the Kepler GK dwarf sample. Through extrapolation, we find that the one year orbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate = 0.1, with an allowed range of 2, where is defined as the number of planets per star within 20\% of the and of Earth.

  abstract = {Context. Previous theoretical works on planet formation around low-mass stars have often been limited to large planets and individual systems. As current surveys routinely detect planets down to terrestrial size in these systems, models have shifted toward a more holistic approach that reflects their diverse architectures. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Here, we investigate planet formation around low-mass stars and identify differences in the statistical distribution of modeled planets. We compare the synthetic planet populations to observed exoplanets and we discuss the identified trends. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We used the Generation III Bern global model of planet formation and evolution to calculate synthetic populations, while varying the central star from Solar-like stars to ultra-late M dwarfs. This model includes planetary migration, N-body interactions between embryos, accretion of planetesimals and gas, and the long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous atmospheres. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most frequent around early M dwarfs (0.3 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}-0.5 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) and that they are more rare for Solar-type stars and late M dwarfs. The planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass. The reason behind this is attributed to the emergence of giant planets for M\textsubscript{{$\star$}} {$\geq$} 0.5 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}, which leads to the ejection of smaller planets. Given a linear scaling of the disk mass with stellar mass, the formation of Earth-like planets is limited by the available amount of solids for ultra-late M dwarfs. For M\textsubscript{{$\star$}} {$\geq$} 0.3 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}, however, there is sufficient mass in the majority of systems, leading to a similar amount of Exo-Earths going from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths and larger planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further identify a regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems such as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs, such as GJ 3512b, only form when type I migration is substantially reduced. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: We are able to quantify the stellar mass dependence of multi-planet systems using global simulations of planet formation and evolution. The results fare well in comparison to current observational data and predict trends that can be tested with future observations. {$<$}P /{$>$}The data supporting these findings are available online at {$<$}A href="http://dace.unige.ch"{$>$}http://dace.unige.ch{$<$}/A{$>$} under section "Formation \&amp; Evolution".},

Therefore, scheduling strategies should be implemented to maximize the amount of information gathered about the target planetary systems. We present one random scheduler and two types of uniform-in-phase schedulers: one myopic, which selects targets one-at-a-time, and one non-myopic that efficiently explores all the possible combinations between stars to be observed and available time slots. We compare these strategies with respect to the bias, accuracy and precision achieved in recovering the mass and orbital parameters of transiting and non-transiting planets from the mock radial-velocity follow-up of a sample of 50 TESS target stars, with simulated planetary systems containing at least one transiting planet with a radius below \$4R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. For each system and strategy, 10 radial-velocity datasets were generated and analysed using a fully Bayesian methodology. We find the myopic strategies lead to a biased estimation of the order of 5\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% of the mass of the transiting exoplanets while the non-myopic scheduler is able to provide an unbiased (\textbackslash textless1\$\textbackslash backslash\$\%) measurement of the masses while keeping the relative accuracy and precision around 16\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% and 23\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% respectively. The number of non-transiting planets detected is similar for all the strategies considered, although the random scheduler leads to less biased and more accurate estimates for their mass and orbital parameters, possibly due to a higher mean number of scheduled radial-velocities for the datasets associated with non-transiting planets detections.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of the protoplanetary disc surrounding AB Aurigae have revealed the possible presence of two giant planets in the process of forming. The young measured age of \$1-4\$Myr for this system allows us to place strict time constraints on the formation histories of the observed planets. Hence we may be able to make a crucial distinction between formation through core accretion (CA) or the gravitational instability (GI), as CA formation timescales are typically Myrs whilst formation through GI will occur within the first \$\textbackslash backslashapprox10\^4-10\^5\$yrs of disc evolution. We focus our analysis on the \$4-13\$M\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Jup\}\$ planet observed at \$R\textbackslash backslashapprox30\$AU. We find CA formation timescales for such a massive planet typically exceed the system's age. The planet's high mass and wide orbit may instead be indicative of formation through GI. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to determine the system's critical disc mass for fragmentation, finding \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm d,crit\}=0.3\$M\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashodot\}\$. Viscous evolution models of the disc's mass history indicate that it was likely massive enough to exceed \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm d,crit\}\$ in the recent past, thus it is possible that a young AB Aurigae disc may have fragmented to form multiple giant gaseous protoplanets. Calculations of the Jeans mass in an AB Aurigae-like disc find that fragments may initially form with masses \$1.6-13.3\$M\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Jup\}\$, consistent with the planets which have been observed. We therefore propose that the inferred planets in the disc surrounding AB Aurigae may be evidence of planet formation through GI.},

  abstract = {Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) is a theory addressing the origin of Systems of Tightly-Packed Inner Planets (STIPs) via \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it in situ\} formation and growth of the planets. It predicts that a pebble ring is established at the pressure maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB) with an inner disk magnetorotational instability (MRI)-active region. Using direct \$N\$-body simulations, we study the collisional evolution of planetesimals formed from such a pebble ring, in particular examining whether a single dominant planet emerges. We consider a variety of models, including some in which the planetesimals are continuing to grow via pebble accretion. We find that the planetesimal ring undergoes oligarchic evolution, and typically turns into 2 or 3 surviving oligarchs on nearly coplanar and circular orbits, independent of the explored initial conditions or form of pebble accretion. The most massive oligarchs typically consist of about \$70\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the total mass, with the building-up process typically finishing within \$\textbackslash backslashsim 10\^5\$ years. However, a relatively massive secondary planet always remains with \$\textbackslash backslashsim30-65\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the mass of the primary. Such secondary planets have properties that are inconsistent with the observed properties of the innermost pairs of planets in STIPs. Thus, for IOPF to be a viable theory for STIP formation, it needs to be shown how oligarchic growth of a relatively massive secondary from the initial pebble ring can be avoided. We discuss some potential additional physical processes that should be included in the modeling and explored as next steps.},

  abstract = {Planet formation simulations are capable of directly integrating the evolution of hundreds to thousands of planetary embryos and planetesimals, as they accrete pairwise to become planets. In principle such investigations allow us to better understand the final configuration and geochemistry of the terrestrial planets, as well as to place our solar system in the context of other exosolar systems. These simulations, however, classically prescribe collisions to result in perfect mergers, but computational advances have begun to allow for more complex outcomes to be implemented. Here we apply machine learning to a large but sparse database of giant impact studies, streamlining simulations into a classi-fier of collision outcomes and a regressor of accretion efficiency. The classifier maps a 4-Dimensional parameter space (target mass, projectile-to-target mass ratio, impact velocity, impact angle) into the four major collision types: merger, "graze-and-merge", "hit-and-run", and disruption. The definition of the four regimes and their boundary is fully data-driven; the results do not suffer from any model assumption in the fitting. The classifier maps the structure of the parameter space and provides insights about the outcome regimes. The regressor is a neural network which is trained to closely mimic the functional relationship between the 4-D space of collision parameters, and a real-variable outcome, the mass of the largest remnant. This work is a prototype of a more complete surrogate model, based on extended sets of simulations ("big data"), that will quickly and reliably predict specific collision outcomes for use in realistic N-body dynamical studies of planetary formation.},

  abstract = {Stellar magnetic activity produces time-varying distortions in the photospheric line profiles of solar-type stars. The changing shape of the profile produces systematic errors in high-precision radial-velocity measurements, which limit efforts to discover and measure the masses of low-mass exoplanets with orbital periods of more than a few tens of days. We present a new data-driven method for separating Doppler shifts of dynamical origin from apparent velocity variations arising from variability-induced changes in the stellar spectrum. It uses the invariance to translation in the velocity domain of the autocorrelation function of the spectrum (and of its cross-correlation function). By projecting the measured velocity time series onto the principal components of the autocorrelation function, we isolate the velocity perturbations caused by solar magnetic activity. Dynamical shifts are preserved when we subtract the projected perturbations from the original velocity measurements. We demonstrate its effectiveness using a 5-year time sequence of 880 daily-averaged cross-correlation functions of the solar spectrum from the HARPS-N instrument and solar-telescope feed on the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, reduced with a new version of the HARPS-N data-reduction pipeline. We inject synthetic low-mass planet signals with amplitude K = 40 cm s-1 into the solar observations at a wide range of orbital periods. We find that our method isolates these signals effectively from solar activity signals. Their semi-amplitudes are recovered with a precision of {$\sim$} 4.4 cm s-1, opening the door to Doppler detection and characterization of terrestrial-mass planets around well-observed, bright main-sequence stars across a wide range of orbital periods.},

These observations are the first detection of near-IR H 2 emission in HD 100546. The H2 1-0 S(1) lines observed in HD 100546 and HD 97048 are observed at a velocity consistent with the rest velocity of both stars, suggesting that they are produced in the circumstellar disk. In HD 97048 the emission is spatially resolved and it is observed to extend at least up to 200 AU from the star. We report an increase of one order of magnitude in the H2 1-0 S(1) line flux with respect to previous measurements taken in 2003 for this star, which suggests line variability. In HD 100546 the emission is tentatively spatially resolved and may extend at least up to 50 AU from the star. Modeling of the H2 1-0 S(1) line profiles and their spatial extent with flat Keplerian disks shows that most of the emission is produced at a radius larger than 5 AU. Upper limits to the H 2 1-0 S(0)/1-0 S(1) and H2 2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) line ratios in HD 97048 are consistent with H2 gas at T \textbackslash textgreater 2000 K and suggest that the emission observed may be produced by X-ray excitation. The upper limits for the line ratios for HD 100546 are inconclusive. Because the H2 emission is located at large radii, for both sources a thermal emission scenario (i.e., gas heated by collisions with dust) is implausible. We argue that the observation of H2 emission at large radii may be indicative of an extended disk atmosphere at radii \textbackslash textgreater5 AU. This may be explained by a hydrostatic disk in which gas and dust are thermally decoupled or by a disk wind caused by photoevaporation. \textcopyright{} 2011 ESO.},

Life as we know it utilizes amino acids, nucleic acids, and lipids for the metabolic, informational, and compartment-forming subsystems of a cell. Such building blocks may have formed simultaneously from cyanosulfidic chemical precursors in a planetary surface scenario involving ultraviolet light, wet-dry cycling, and volcanism. However, early Earth was a water world, and the timing of the rise of oxygen on Earth is inconsistent with final fixation of the genetic code in response to oxidative stress. A cyanosulfidic origin of life could have taken place on Mars via photoredox chemistry, facilitated by orders of magnitude more sub-aerial crust than early Earth, and an earlier transition to oxidative conditions. Meteoritic bombardment may have generated transient habitable environments and ejected and transferred life to Earth. The Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover offers an unprecedented opportunity to confirm or refute evidence consistent with a cyanosulfidic origin of life on Mars, search for evidence of ancient life, and constrain the evolution of Mars' oxidation state over time. We should seek to prove or refute a Martian origin for life on Earth alongside other possibilities.},

  abstract = {Understanding planet formation requires to discern how dust grows in protoplanetary disks. An important parameter to measure in disks is the maximum dust grain size present. This is usually estimated through measurements of the dust opacity at different millimeter wavelengths assuming optically thin emission and dust opacity dominated by absorption. However, ALMA observations have shown that these assumptions might not be correct in the case of protoplanetary disks, leading to overestimation of particle sizes and to underestimation of the disk's mass. Here, we present an analysis of high quality ALMA and VLA images of the HL{$\sim$}Tau protoplanetary disk, covering a wide range of wavelengths, from 0.8{$\sim$}mm to 1{$\sim$}cm, and with a physical resolution of \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$7.35{$\sim$}au. We describe a procedure to analyze a set of millimeter images without any assumption about the optical depth of the emission, and including the effects of absorption and scattering in the dust opacity. This procedure allows us to obtain the dust temperature, the dust surface density and the maximum particle size at each radius. In the HL{$\sim$}Tau disk, we found that particles have already grown up to a few millimeters in size. We detect differences in the dust properties between dark and bright rings, with dark rings containing low dust density and small dust particles. Different features in the HL{$\sim$}Tau disk seem to have different origins. Planet-disk interactions can explain substructure at the external half of the disk, but the internal rings seem to be associated to the presence of snow lines of several molecules.},

Planets below that curve are likely to have experienced complete photoevaporation. Furthermore, planets just above this curve appear to have inflated radii; thus we identify a new population of inflated super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our N-body simulations are set within an evolving protoplanetary disk and include prescriptions for orbital migration, gas accretion and atmospheric loss due to giant impacts. Our simulated systems broadly match the sizes and periods of super-Earths in the Kepler catalog. They also match the relative sizes of adjacent planets in the same system, with the exception of planet pairs that straddle the photo-evaporation valley. This latter group is populated by planet pairs with either very large or very small size ratios (\$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm out\} / R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm in\} \textbackslash backslashgg 1\$ or \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm out\} / R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm in\} \textbackslash backslashll 1\$) and a dearth of size ratios near unity. It appears that this feature could be reproduced if the planet outside the photoevaporation valley (typically the outer planet, but some times not) is substantially inflated. This new population of inflated planets may be ideal targets for future transit spectroscopy observations with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.},

Therefore, origin of rocky short period planets with \$P \textbackslash textless 10\$ days is a puzzle. We propose that many of these planets may form through the Type-I migration of planets locked into a chain of mutual mean motion resonances. We ran N-body simulations of planetary embryos embedded in a protoplanetary disk. The embryos experienced gravitational scatterings, collisions, disk torques, and dampening of orbital eccentricity and inclination. We then modelled Kepler observations of these planets using a forward model of both the transit probability and the detection efficiency of the Kepler pipeline. We found that planets become locked into long chains of mean motion resonances that migrate in unison. When the chain reaches the edge of the disk, the inner planets are pushed past the edge due to the disk torques acting on the planets farther out in the chain. Our simulated systems successfully reproduce the observed period distribution of short period Kepler planets between 1 and 2 \$R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. However, we obtain fewer closely packed short period planets than in the Kepler sample. Our results provide valuable insight into the planet formation process, and suggests that resonance locks, migration, and dynamical instabilities play important roles the the formation and evolution of close-in small exoplanets.},

  abstract = {Axisymmetric dust rings are a ubiquitous feature of young protoplanetary disks. These rings are likely caused by pressure bumps in the gas profile; a small bump can induce a traffic jam-like pattern in the dust density, while a large bump may halt radial dust drift entirely. The resulting increase in dust concentration may trigger planetesimal formation by the streaming instability (SI), as the SI itself requires some initial concentration. Here we present the first 3D simulations of planetesimal formation in the presence of a pressure bump modeled specifically after those observed by ALMA. In particular, we place a pressure bump at the center of a large 3D shearing box, along with an initial solid-to-gas ratio of \$Z = 0.01\$, and we include both particle back-reaction and particle self-gravity. We consider both mm-sized and cm-sized particles separately. For simulations with cm-sized particles, we find that even a small pressure bump leads to the formation of planetesimals via the streaming instability; a pressure bump does \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it not\} need to fully halt radial particle drift for the SI to become efficient. Furthermore, pure gravitational collapse via concentration in pressure bumps (such as would occur at sufficiently high concentrations and without the streaming instability) is not responsible for planetesimal formation. For mm-sized particles, we find tentative evidence that planetesimal formation does not occur. This result, if it holds up at higher resolution and for a broader range of parameters, could put strong constraints on where in protoplanetary disks planetesimals can form. Ultimately, however, our results suggest that for cm-sized particles, planetesimal formation in pressure bumps is an extremely robust process.},

As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for \$m\textbackslash backslashga 1 \textbackslash backslashmsol\$ and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one \$\textbackslash backslashsim 0.1 \textbackslash backslashpc3\$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \$\textbackslash backslashsim 1 \textbackslash backslashmsol\$. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

We investigate the stability of systems of more than two planets using numerical integrations. We find that systems with {$\Delta$} \textbackslash textless 10 are always unstable, with the time, t, of first close encounter given approximately by log t = b{$\Delta$} + c, where b and c are constants. It is likely that systems with {$\Delta$} \textbackslash textgreater 10 are also unstable. The slope b depends weakly on the number of planets, but is independent of planetary mass, m, if we measure {$\Delta$} in units that are proportional to m1/4 rather than the usual RH {$\propto$} m1/3. Instability in multi-planet systems arises because energy and angular momentum are no longer conserved within each two-planet subsystem due to perturbations by the additional planet(s). These results suggest that planetary embryos will not become isolated prior to the final stage of terrestrial-planet formation simply due to a failure to achieve close encounters. Other factors leading to isolation cannot be ruled out at this stage. \textcopyright{} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

The disk is assumed to be flared and viscosity is assumed to follow an "alpha" model, where viscosity is proportional to the local sound speed and scale height. In the inner disk, the midplane temperature is mainly determined by the energy released by the viscous accretion of material through the disk and onto the star. In the outer disk, stellar irradiation is the dominant heat source. A third regime is present in the innermost part of the disk, where viscous heating dominates but the opacity declines rapidly with increasing temperature due to dust grain sublimation. Changes in the protostellar radius and luminosity over time are readily incorporated into the model, although these have a relatively minor effect on the disk evolution. The model yields the surface density and midplane temperature at any point in space and time during the lifetime of the disk. It is especially suited to studies of planet formation that require a self-consistent model of disk evolution with minimal computational expense. \textcopyright{} 2009.

  abstract = {The physics of planet formation is investigated using a population synthesis approach. We develop a simple model for planetary growth including pebble and gas accretion, and orbital migration in an evolving protoplanetary disk. The model is run for a population of 2000 stars with a range of disk masses and radii, and initial protoplanet orbits. The resulting planetary distribution is compared with the observed population of extrasolar planets, and the model parameters are improved iteratively using a particle swarm optimization scheme. The characteristics of the final planetary systems are mainly controlled by the pebble isolation mass, which is the mass of a planet that perturbs nearby gas enough to halt the inward flux of drifting pebbles and stop growth. The pebble isolation mass increases with orbital distance so that giant planet cores can only form in the outer disk. Giants migrate inwards, populating a wide range of final orbital distances. The best model fits have large initial protoplanet masses, short pebble drift timescales, low disk viscosities, and short atmospheric cooling times, all of which promote rapid growth. The model successfully reproduces the observed frequency and distribution of giant planets and brown dwarfs. The fit for super Earths is poorer for single-planet systems, but improves steadily when more protoplanets are included. Although the study was designed to match the extrasolar planet distribution, analogs of the Solar System form in 1-2\% of systems that contain at least 4 protoplanets.},

  abstract = {The formation of gas-giant planets within the lifetime of a protoplanetary disk is challenging especially far from a star. A promising model for the rapid formation of giant-planet cores is pebble accretion in which gas drag during encounters leads to high accretion rates. Most models of pebble accretion consider disks with a monotonic, radial pressure profile. This causes a continuous inward flux of pebbles and inefficient growth. Here we examine planet formation in a disk with multiple, intrinsic pressure bumps. In the outer disk, pebbles become trapped near these bumps allowing rapid growth under suitable conditions. In the inner disk, pebble traps may not exist because the inward gas advection velocity is too high. Pebbles here are rapidly removed. In the outer disk, growth is very sensitive to the initial planet mass and the strength of turbulence. This is because turbulent density fluctuations raise planetary eccentricities, increasing the planet-pebble relative velocity. Planetary seeds above a distance-dependent critical mass grow to a Jupiter mass in 0.5\textendash 3 million years out to at least 60 AU in a 0.03 solar-mass disk. Smaller bodies remain near their initial mass, leading to a sharp dichotomy in growth outcomes. For turbulent alpha = 1e-4, the critical masses are 1e-4 and 1e-3 Earth masses at 9 and 75 AU, respectively. Pressure bumps in disks may explain the large mass difference between the giant planets and Kuiper belt objects, and also the existence of wide-orbit planets in some systems.},

We also provide an assessment of the planet's orbital dynamics at different epochs of Saturn's growth. We find that the evolution of initially compact orbital configurations is dependent on the value of Delta a\_SJ . This implies that an evolution as that proposed in the Grand Tack model depends on the precise initial orbits of Jupiter and Saturn and on the timescales for their formation. Capture in the 1:2 MMR and inward or (nearly) stalled migration are highly favoured. Within its limits, our work suggests that the reversed migration, associated with the resonance capture of Jupiter and Saturn, may be a low probability evolutionary scenario, so that other planetary systems with giant planets are not expected to have experienced a Grand Tack-like evolutionary path.},

However, it is yet to be seen if the configuration of fully evolved exoplanetary systems can yield information about the later stages of their primordial disks. We use synthetic exoplanet population data from Monte Carlo simulations of systems forming under different density perturbation conditions, which are based on current observations of transitional disks. The simulations use a core instability, oligarchic growth, dust trap analytical model that has been benchmarked against exoplanetary populations.},

This field of astrophysics is currently in an observationally-driven phase, and the bulk of research activity in the past decade has been fueled initially by precise radial-velocity measurements (Udry, Fischer, \& Queloz 2007), and, more recently, by the combination of that technique with transit photometry (Charbonneau et al. 2007). Planetary systems for which both the radial-velocity orbit and the transit light curve are measured permit us to determine the mass and radius of the planet, which in turn yield powerful constraints on its physical structure and bulk composition. The true power of a transiting geometry, however, is that it permits the study of the planetary atmosphere without the need to spatially isolate the light from the planet from that of the star. It is this technique, which we term "occultation spectroscopy", that yielded the first emergent spectra of planets orbiting nearby Sun-like stars (Richardson et al. 2007; Grillmair et al. 2007; Swain et al. 2007)},

  abstract = {Aims. The SHINE program is a high-contrast near-infrared survey of 600 young, nearby stars aimed at searching for and characterizing new planetary systems using VLT/SPHERE's unprecedented high-contrast and high-angular-resolution imaging capabilities. It is also intended to place statistical constraints on the rate, mass and orbital distributions of the giant planet population at large orbits as a function of the stellar host mass and age to test planet-formation theories. Methods. We used the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE to acquire high-contrast coronagraphic differential near-infrared images and spectra of the young A2 star HIP 65426. It is a member of the {$\sim$}17 Myr old Lower Centaurus-Crux association. Results. At a separation of 830 mas (92 au projected) from the star, we detect a faint red companion. Multi-epoch observations confirm that it shares common proper motion with HIP 65426. Spectro-photometric measurements extracted with IFS and IRDIS between 0.95 and 2.2 {$\mu$}m indicate a warm, dusty atmosphere characteristic of young low-surface-gravity L5-L7 dwarfs. Hot-start evolutionary models predict a luminosity consistent with a 6-12 MJup, Teff = 1300-1600 K and R = 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.1 RJup giant planet. Finally, the comparison with Exo-REM and PHOENIX BT-Settl synthetic atmosphere models gives consistent effective temperatures but with slightly higher surface gravity solutions of log (g) = 4.0-5.0 with smaller radii (1.0-1.3 RJup). Conclusions. Given its physical and spectral properties, HIP 65426 b occupies a rather unique placement in terms of age, mass, and spectral-type among the currently known imaged planets. It represents a particularly interesting case to study the presence of clouds as a function of particle size, composition, and location in the atmosphere, to search for signatures of non-equilibrium chemistry, and finally to test the theory of planet formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {A critical question in astrobiology is whether exoEarth candidates (EECs) are Earth-like, in that they originate life that progressively oxygenates their atmospheres similarly to Earth. We propose answering this question statistically by searching for O2 and O3 on EECs with missions such as HabEx or LUVOIR. We explore the ability of these missions to constrain the fraction, fE, of EECs that are Earth-like in the event of a null detection of O2 or O3 on all observed EECs. We use the Planetary Spectrum Generator to simulate observations of EECs with O2 and O3 levels based on Earth's history. We consider four instrument designs: LUVOIR-A (15m), LUVOIR-B (8m), HabEx with a starshade (4m, "HabEx/SS"), HabEx without a starshade (4m, "HabEx/no-SS"); as well as three estimates of the occurrence rate of EECs (eta\_earth): 24\%, 5\%, and 0.5\%. In the case of a null-detection, we find that for eta\_earth = 24\%, LUVOIR-A, LUVOIR-B, and HabEx/SS would constrain fE to \textbackslash textless= 0.094, \textbackslash textless= 0.18, and \textbackslash textless= 0.56, respectively. This also indicates that if fE is greater than these upper limits, we are likely to detect O3 on at least 1 EEC. Conversely, we find that HabEx/no-SS cannot constrain fE, due to the lack of an coronagraph ultraviolet channel. For eta\_earth = 5\%, only LUVOIR-A and LUVOIR-B would be able to constrain fE, to \textbackslash textless= 0.45 and \textbackslash textless= 0.85, respectively. For eta\_earth = 0.5\%, none of the missions would allow us to constrain fE, due to the low number of detectable EECs. We conclude that the ability to constrain fE is more robust to uncertainties in eta\_earth for missions with larger aperture mirrors. However all missions are susceptible to an inconclusive null detection if eta\_earth is sufficiently low.},

Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these terms, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present am unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth), and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius relation at \$2.0\_\{-0.6\}\^\{+0.7\} M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky Super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the Super-Earth we have been looking for.},

  abstract = {Life appears to have emerged relatively quickly on the Earth, a fact sometimes used to justify a high rate of spontaneous abiogenesis (\$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$) among Earth-like worlds. Conditioned upon a single datum - the time of earliest evidence for life (\$t\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{obs\}\}\$) - previous Bayesian formalisms for the posterior distribution of \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$ have demonstrated how inferences are highly sensitive to the priors. Rather than attempt to infer the true \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$ posterior, we here compute the relative change to \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$ when new experimental/observational evidence is introduced. By simulating posterior distributions and resulting entropic information gains, we compare three experimental pressures on \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$: 1) evidence for an earlier start to life; \$t\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{obs\}\}\$; 2) constraints on spontaneous abiogenesis from the lab; and 3) an exoplanet survey for biosignatures. First, we find that experiments 1 and 2 can only yield lower limits on \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$, unlike 3. Second, evidence for an earlier start to life can yield negligible information on \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$ if \$t\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{obs\}\} \textbackslash backslashll \textbackslash backslashlambda\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{max\}\}\^\{-1\}\$. Vice versa, experiment 2 is uninformative when \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{max\}\} \textbackslash backslashgg t\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{obs\}\}\^\{-1\}\$. Whilst experiment 3 appears the most direct means of measuring \$\textbackslash backslashlambda\$, we highlight that early starts inform us of the conditions of abiogenesis, and that lab experiments could succeed in building new life. Together then, the three experiments are complimentary and we encourage activity in all to solve this grand challenge.},

  abstract = {The omnipresence of super-Earths suggests that they are able to be retained in natal disks around low-mass stars, whereas exoplanets' mass distribution indicates that some cores have transformed into gas giants through runaway gas accretion at 1AU from solar-type stars. In this paper, we show that transition to runaway gas accretion by cores may be self-impeded by an increase of the grain opacity in their envelope after they have acquired sufficient mass (typically 10Mearth) to enter a pebble-isolation phase. The accumulation of mm-m size pebbles in their migration barriers enhances their local fragmentation rates. The freshly produced sub-mm grains pass through the barrier, elevate the effective dust opacity and reduce the radiative flux in the cores envelope. These effects alone are adequate to suppress the transition to runaway accretion and preserve super-Earths in the stellar proximity (0.1 AU), albeit entropy advection between the envelope and the disk can further reduce the accretion rate. At intermediate distance (1AU) from their host stars, the escalation in the dust opacity dominates over entropy advection in stalling the transition to runaway accretion for marginally pebble-isolated cores. Beyond a few AU, the transformation of more massive cores to gas giants is reachable before severe depletion of disk gas. This requirement can be satisfied either in extended disks with large scale height via orderly accretion of migrating pebbles or through the mergers of oligarchic protoplanetary embryos, and can account for the correlated occurrence of long-period gas giants and close-in super-Earths.},

This is the theoretical end point of tidal evolution where transfer of angular momentum has ceased. Here we follow Pluto's tidal evolution from an initial state having the current total angular momentum of the system but with Charon in an eccentric orbit with semimajor axis a {$\approx$} 4R P (where R P is the radius of Pluto), consistent with its impact origin. Two tidal models are used, where the tidal dissipation function Q {$\propto$} 1/frequency and Q=constant, where details of the evolution are strongly model dependent. The inclusion of the gravitational harmonic coefficient C22 of both bodies in the analysis allows smooth, self consistent evolution to the dual synchronous state, whereas its omission frustrates successful evolution in some cases. The zonal harmonic J2 can also be included, but does not cause a significant effect on the overall evolution. The ratio of dissipation in Charon to that in Pluto controls the behavior of the orbital eccentricity, where a judicious choice leads to a nearly constant eccentricity until the final approach to dual synchronous rotation. The tidal models are complete in the sense that every nuance of tidal evolution is realized while conserving total angular momentum-including temporary capture into spin-orbit resonances as Charon's spin decreases and damped librations about the same. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the radii and masses of adjacent planets within a planetary system are correlated. It is unknown how this 'peas-in-a-pod' phenomenon originates, whether it is in place at birth or requires evolution, and whether it (initially) applies only to neighboring planets or to all planets within a system. Here we address these questions by making use of the recent discovery that planetary system architectures strongly depend on ambient stellar clustering. Based on Gaia's second data release, we divide the sample of planetary systems hosting multiple planets into those residing in stellar position-velocity phase space overdensities and the field, representing samples with elevated and low degrees of external perturbation, respectively. We demonstrate that the peas-in-a-pod phenomenon manifests itself in both samples, suggesting that the uniformity of planetary properties within a system is not restricted to direct neighbors and likely already exists at birth. The radius uniformity is significantly elevated in overdensities, suggesting that it can be enhanced by evolutionary effects that either have a similar impact on the entire planetary system or favour the retention of similar planets. The mass uniformity may exhibit a similar, but weaker dependence. Finally, we find ordering in both samples, with the planet radius and mass increasing outwards. Despite its prevalence, the ordering is somewhat weaker in overdensities, suggesting that it may be disrupted by external perturbations arising from stellar clustering. We conclude that a comprehensive understanding of the 'peas-in-a-pod' phenomenon requires linking planet formation and evolution to the large-scale stellar and galactic environment.},

This layer re-emits directly to space about half the stellar energy it absorbs. The other half is emitted inward and regulates the interior temperature of the disk. The heated disk flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat disk would. The portion of the spectral energy distribution contributed by the disk is fairly flat throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency, the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted at more than an order of magnitude greater radius. Spectral features from dust grains in the superheated layer appear in emission if the disk is viewed nearly face-on.},

Using an updated collision model, we conduct a suite of high resolution N-body integrations to probe the relationship between giant planet mass, and terrestrial planet formation and system architecture. We vary the mass of the planets that reside at Jupiter's and Saturn's orbit and examine the effects on the interior terrestrial system. We find a correlation between the mass of the exterior giant planets and the collision history of the resulting planets, which holds implications for the planet's properties. More massive giants also produce terrestrial planets that are on smaller, more circular orbits. We do not find a strong correlation between exterior giant planet mass and the number of Earth-analogs (analogous in mass and semi-major axis) produced in the system. These results allow us to make predictions on the nature of terrestrial planets orbiting distant Sun-like star systems that harbor giant planet companions on long orbits\textemdash systems which will be a priority for NASA's upcoming Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST) mission.},

There are deficits of systems\textemdash "troughs'' in the period ratio histogram\textemdash just short of commensurability, and excesses\textemdash "peaks''\textemdash just wide of it. We reproduce quantitatively the strongest peak-trough asymmetries, near the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances, using dissipative interactions between planets and their natal disks. Disk eccentricity damping captures bodies into resonance and clears the trough, and when combined with disk-driven convergent migration, draws planets initially wide of commensurability into the peak. The migration implied by the magnitude of the peak is modest; reductions in orbital period are \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$10\$\textbackslash backslash\$\%, supporting the view that sub-Neptunes complete their formation more-or-less in situ. Once captured into resonance, sub-Neptunes of typical mass \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$\$5\$\textendash\$15 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ stay captured (contrary to an earlier claim), as they are immune to the overstability that afflicts lower mass planets. Driving the limited, short-scale migration is a gas disk whose surface density is fairly constant inside 1 AU and depleted relative to a solar-composition disk by 3\textendash 5 orders of magnitude. Such gas-poor but not gas-empty environments are quantitatively consistent with sub-Neptune core formation by giant impacts (and not, e.g., pebble accretion). While disk-planet interactions at the close of the planet formation era adequately explain the 3:2 and 2:1 asymmetries at periods \$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim\$ \$5\$\textendash\$15\$ days, subsequent modification by stellar tides appears necessary at shorter periods, particularly for the 2:1.},

  abstract = {Context. The origin of giant planets at moderate separations \$\textbackslash backslashsimeq\$\$1\$\$-\$\$10\$ au is still not fully understood because numerical studies of Type II migration in protoplanetary disks often predict a decay of the semi-major axis that is too fast. According to recent 2D simulations, inward migration of a gap-opening planet can be slowed down or even reversed if the outer gap edge becomes heated by irradiation from the central star, and puffed up. Aims. Here we study how stellar irradiation reduces the disk-driven torque and affects migration in more realistic 3D disks. Methods. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations with radiation transfer, we investigated the static torque acting on a single gap-opening planet embedded in a passively heated accretion disk. Results. Our simulations confirm that a temperature inversion is established at the irradiated outer gap edge and the local increase of the scale height reduces the magnitude of the negative outer Lindblad torque. However, the temperature excess is smaller than assumed in 2D simulations and the torque reduction only becomes prominent for specific parameters. For the viscosity \$\textbackslash backslashalpha=10\^\{-3\}\$, the total torque is reduced for planetary masses ranging from \$0.1\$ to \$0.7\$ Jupiter mass, with the strongest reduction being by a factor of \$-0.17\$ (implying outward migration) for a Saturn-mass planet. For a Jupiter-mass planet, the torque reduction becomes stronger with increasing \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ (the torque is halved when \$\textbackslash backslashalpha=5\textbackslash backslashtimes10\^\{-3\}\$). Conclusions. We conclude that planets that open moderately wide and deep gaps are subject to the largest torque modifications and their Type II migration can be stalled due to gap edge illumination. We then argue that the torque reduction can help to stabilize the orbits of giant planets forming at \$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim\$\$1\$ au.},

In addition we investigate the dependence of the detection efficiency on parameters of the target stars and their location in the Kepler field of view. We find that the end-of-mission version of the Kepler pipeline returns to a high overall detection efficiency, averaging a 90-95\% rate of detection for strong signals across a wide variety of parameter space. We find a weak dependence of the detection efficiency on the number of transits contributing to the signal and the orbital period of the signal, and a stronger dependence on the stellar effective temperature and correlated noise properties. We also find a weak dependence of the detection efficiency on the position within the field of view.

The dynamics is opposite in direction to what has been theorized for viscous and magnetized accretion disks in which gas spreads out and away from either side of any conceivable intermediate area.

  abstract = {The moons of giant planets are believed to form in situ in Circumplanetary Discs (CPDs). Here we present an N-body population synthesis framework for satellite formation around a Jupiter-like planet, in which the dust-to-gas ratio, the accretion rate of solids from the Protoplanetary Disc, the number, and the initial positions of protosatellites were randomly chosen from realistic distributions. The disc properties were from 3D radiative simulations sampled in 1D and 2D grids and evolved semi-analytically with time. The N-body satellitesimals accreted mass from the dust component of the disc, interacted gravitationally with each other, experienced close-encounters, both scattering and colliding. With this improved modeling, we found that about \$15\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the resulting population is more massive than the Galilean one, and only \$8.5\textbackslash backslash\%\$ were in resonances. The moons reach Europa's mass most frequently in \$10\^5\$ years. In \$10\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the cases, moons are engulfed by the planet, and \$1\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the satellite-systems lose at least 1 Earth-mass into the planet, contributing to the giant planet's envelope's heavy element content. In \$1\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of cases, we found eccentricities and inclinations of moons above 0.1. We examined the differences in outcome between the 1D and 2D disc models and used machine learning (Randomized Dependence Coefficient together with t-SNE) to compare our population with the Galilean system. Detecting our population around known transiting Jupiter-like planets via transits and TTVs would be challenging, but \$14\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the moons could be with an instrumental transit sensitivity of \$10\^\{-5\}\$.},

Previous three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of low-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc, contrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is referred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this paper, we investigate the recycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D radiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the evolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D atmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses entropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high-entropy gas from the disc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, potentially arresting envelope growth at a subcritical gas mass fraction. Recycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous studies. However, we also identify an 'inner core' - in size {$\approx$} 25 per cent of the Bondi radius - where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much lower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are needed to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically isolated on long time-scales.},

We show that in combination these processes generate the observed `two-time-scale' behaviour for the dispersal of such discs, whereby the disc is rapidly dispersed at the end of its life on a time-scale that is a small fraction of the disc lifetime. This switch is activated when the accretion rate through the disc declines to a low level (a few times 10-10Msolaryr-1) such that it roughly matches the rate of photoevaporative mass loss from the disc outside 5-10au. At this point, the inner disc is deprived of further replenishment from larger radii and empties on to the central star on its own short viscous time-scale. This causes the rapid ({$\sim$}105-yr) decline in accretion rate on to the central star and in all disc-related emission shortward of 10{$\mu$}m. We discuss the implications of this model for the detection of millimetre emission around weak-line T Tauri stars, and also point out the consequences of such a sudden draining for planet formation in the inner regions of circumstellar discs.},

  abstract = {The solar system's terrestrial planets are thought to have accreted over millions of years out of a sea of smaller embryos and planetesimals. Because it is impossible to know the surface density profile for solids and size frequency distribution in the primordial solar nebula, distinguishing between the various proposed evolutionary schemes has been historically difficult. Nearly all previous simulations of terrestrial planet formation assume that Moon to Mars massed embryos formed throughout the inner solar system during the primordial gas-disk phase. However, validating this assumption through models of embryo accretion is computationally challenging because of the large number of bodies required. Here, we reevaluate this problem with GPU-accelerated, direct N-body simulations of embryo growth starting from r{$\sim$}100 km planetesimals. We find that embryos emerging from the primordial gas phase at a given radial distance already have masses similar to the largest objects at the same semi-major axis in the modern solar system. Thus, Earth and Venus attain {$\sim$}50\% of their modern mass, Mars-massed embryos form in the Mars region, and Ceres-massed objects are prevalent throughout asteroid belt. Consistent with other recent work, our new initial conditions for terrestrial accretion models produce markedly improved solar system analogs when evolved through the giant impact phase of planet formation. However, we still conclude that an additional dynamical mechanism such as giant planet migration is required to prevent Earth-massed Mars analogs from growing.},

  abstract = {We present calculations of the occurrence rate of small close-in planets around low mass dwarf stars using the known planet populations from the \$Kepler\$ and \$K2\$ missions. Applying completeness corrections clearly reveals the radius valley in the maximum a-posteriori occurrence rates as a function of orbital separation and planet radius. We measure the slope of the valley to be \$r\_\{p,\textbackslash backslashtext\{valley\}\} \textbackslash backslashpropto F\^\{-0.060\textbackslash backslashpm 0.025\}\$ which bears the opposite sign from that measured around Sun-like stars thus suggesting that thermally driven atmospheric mass loss may not dominate the evolution of planets in the low stellar mass regime or that we are witnessing the emergence of a separate channel of planet formation. The latter notion is supported by the relative occurrence of rocky to non-rocky planets increasing from \$0.5\textbackslash backslashpm 0.1\$ around mid-K dwarfs to \$8.5\textbackslash backslashpm 4.6\$ around mid-M dwarfs. Furthermore, the center of the radius valley at \$1.54\textbackslash backslashpm 0.16\$ R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ is shown to shift to smaller sizes with decreasing stellar mass in agreement with physical models of photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and gas-poor formation. Although current measurements are insufficient to robustly identify the dominant formation pathway of the radius valley, such inferences may be obtained by \$TESS\$ with \$\textbackslash backslashmathcal\{O\}(85,000)\$ mid-to-late M dwarfs observed with 2-minute cadence. The measurements presented herein also precisely designate the subset of planetary orbital periods and radii that should be targeted in radial velocity surveys to resolve the rocky to non-rocky transition around low mass stars.},

  abstract = {Studies of close-in planets orbiting M dwarfs have suggested that the M-dwarf radius valley may be well explained by distinct formation timescales between enveloped terrestrials and rocky planets that form at late times in a gas-depleted environment. This scenario is at odds with the picture that close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is subsequently stripped away by some thermally driven mass-loss process. These two physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped transition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the compositions of planets within the M-dwarf radius valley may be able to establish the dominant physics. Here, we present the discovery of one such keystone planet: the ultra-short-period planet TOI-1634 b (P = 0.989 days, , R {$\oplus$}) orbiting a nearby M2 dwarf (K s = 8.7, R s = 0.450 R {$\odot$}, M s = 0.502 M {$\odot$}) and whose size and orbital period sit within the M-dwarf radius valley. We confirm the TESS-discovered planet candidate using extensive ground-based follow-up campaigns, including a set of 32 precise radial velocity measurements from HARPS-N. We measure a planetary mass of M {$\oplus$}, which makes TOI-1634 b inconsistent with an Earth-like composition at and thus requires either an extended gaseous envelope, a large volatile-rich layer, or a rocky composition that is not dominated by iron and silicates to explain its mass and radius. The discovery that the bulk composition of TOI-1634 b is inconsistent with that of Earth supports the gas-depleted formation mechanism to explain the emergence of the radius valley around M dwarfs with M {$\odot$}.},

  abstract = {Our recent N-body simulations of planetary system formation, incorporating models for the main physical processes thought to be important during the building of planets (i.e. gas disc evolution, migration, planetesimal/boulder accretion, gas accretion onto cores, etc.), have been successful in reproducing some of the broad features of the observed exoplanet population (e.g. compact systems of low mass planets, hot Jupiters), but fail completely to form any surviving cold Jupiters. The primary reason for this failure is rapid inward migration of growing protoplanets during the gas accretion phase, resulting in the delivery of these bodies onto orbits close to the star. Here, we present the results of simulations that examine the formation of gas giant planets in protoplanetary discs that are radially structured due to spatial and temporal variations in the effective viscous stresses, and show that such a model results in the formation of a population of cold gas giants. Furthermore, when combined with models for disc photoevaporation and a central magnetospheric cavity, the simulations reproduce the well-known hot-Jupiter/cold-Jupiter dichotomy in the observed period distribution of giant exoplanets, with a period valley between 10-100 days.},

  abstract = {We present a study into the formation of planetary systems around low mass stars similar to Trappist-1, through the accretion of either planetesimals or pebbles. The aim is to determine if the currently observed systems around low mass stars could favour one scenario over the other. To determine these differences, we ran numerous N-body simulations, coupled to a thermally evolving viscous 1D disc model, and including prescriptions for planet migration, photoevaporation, and pebble and planetesimal dynamics. We mainly examine the differences between the pebble and planetesimal accretion scenarios, but we also look at the influences of disc mass, size of planetesimals, and the percentage of solids locked up within pebbles. When comparing the resulting planetary systems to Trappist-1, we find that a wide range of initial conditions for both the pebble and planetesimal accretion scenarios can form planetary systems similar to Trappist-1, in terms of planet mass, periods, and resonant configurations. Typically these planets formed exterior to the water iceline and migrated in resonant convoys into the inner region close to the central star. When comparing the planetary systems formed through pebble accretion to those formed through planetesimal accretion, we find a large number of similarities, including average planet masses, eccentricities, inclinations, and period ratios. One major difference between the two scenarios was that of the water content of the planets. When including the effects of ablation and full recycling of the planets' envelope with the disc, the planets formed through pebble accretion were extremely dry, whilst those formed through planetesimal accretion were extremely wet. If the water content is not fully recycled and instead falls to the planets' core, or if ablation of the water is neglected, then the planets formed through pebble accretion are extremely wet, similar to those formed through planetesimal accretion. Should the water content of the Trappist-1 planets be determined accurately, this could point to a preferred formation pathway for planetary systems, or to specific physics that may be at play.},

  abstract = {Planet formation models begin with proto-embryos and planetesimals already fully formed, missing out a crucial step, the formation of planetesimals/proto-embryos. In this work, we include prescriptions for planetesimal and proto-embryo formation arising from pebbles becoming trapped in short-lived pressure bumps, in thermally evolving viscous discs to examine the sizes and distributions of proto-embryos and planetesimals throughout the disc. We find that planetesimal sizes increase with orbital distance, from {$\sim$}10 km close to the star to hundreds of kilometres further away. Proto-embryo masses are also found to increase with orbital radius, ranging from \$10\^\{-6\} M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ around the iceline, to \$10\^\{-3\} M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ near the orbit of Pluto. We include prescriptions for pebble and planetesimal accretion to examine the masses that proto-embryos can attain. Close to the star, planetesimal accretion is efficient due to small planetesimals, whilst pebble accretion is efficient where pebble sizes are fragmentation limited, but inefficient when drift dominated due to low accretion rates before the pebble supply diminishes. Exterior to the iceline, planetesimal accretion becomes inefficient due to increasing planetesimal eccentricities, whilst pebble accretion becomes more efficient as the initial proto-embryo masses increase, allowing them to significantly grow before the pebble supply is depleted. Combining both scenarios allows for more massive proto-embryos at larger distances, since the accretion of planetesimals allows pebble accretion to become more efficient, allowing giant planet cores to form at distances upto 10 au. By including more realistic initial proto-embryo and planetesimal sizes, as well as combined accretion scenarios, should allow for a more complete understanding in the beginning to end process of how planets and planetary systems form.},

  abstract = {One of the long-term goals of exoplanet science is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small exoplanets in order to understand their diversity and search for habitable worlds and potential biosignatures. Achieving this goal requires a space mission of sufficient scale. We seek to quantify the exoplanet detection performance of a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer that measures the thermal emission of exoplanets. For this, we have developed an instrument simulator that considers all major astrophysical noise sources and coupled it with Monte Carlo simulations of a synthetic exoplanet population around main-sequence stars within 20 pc. This allows us to quantify the number (and types) of exoplanets that our mission concept could detect over a certain time period. Two different scenarios to distribute the observing time among the stellar targets are discussed and different apertures sizes and wavelength ranges are considered. Within a 2.5-year initial search phase, an interferometer consisting of four 2 m apertures covering a wavelength range between 4 and 18.5 \$\textbackslash backslashmu\$m could detect up to {$\sim$}550 exoplanets with radii between 0.5 and 6 R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ with an integrated SNR\$\textbackslash backslashge\$7. At least {$\sim$}160 of the detected exoplanets have radii \$\textbackslash backslashle\$1.5 R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. Depending on the observing scenario, {$\sim$}25-45 rocky exoplanets (objects with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 \$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$) orbiting within the empirical habitable zone (eHZ) of their host stars are among the detections. With four times 3.5 m aperture size, the total number of detections can increase to up to {$\sim$}770, including {$\sim$}60-80 rocky, eHZ planets. With four times 1 m aperture size, the maximum detection yield is {$\sim$}315 exoplanets, including \$\textbackslash backslashle\$20 rocky, eHZ planets. In terms of predicted detection yield, such a mission can compete with large single-aperture reflected light missions. (abridged)},

This is somehow unexpected, as these planets undergo strong tidal dissipation that should circularize their orbits in a timescale shorter than the age of the system. In this paper we discuss some mechanisms that can oppose to bodily tides, namely, thermal atmospheric tides, evaporation of the atmosphere, and excitation from a distant companion. In the first two cases, the eccentricity can increase consistently, while in the last one, the eccentricity can only be excited for a limited amount of time (that may nevertheless exceed the age of the system). We show the limitations of these different mechanisms and how some of them could, depending on specific properties of the observed planetary systems, account for their presently observed eccentricities.},

  abstract = {Although it is well known that a massive planet opens a gap in a protoplanetary gaseous disk, there is no analytic description of the surface density profile in and near the gap. The simplest approach, which is based upon the balance between the torques due to the viscosity and the gravity of the planet and assumes local damping, leads to gaps with overestimated width, especially at low viscosity. Here, we take into account the fraction of the gravity torque that is evacuated by pressure supported waves. With a novel approach, which consists of following the fluid elements along their trajectories, we show that the flux of angular momentum carried by the waves corresponds to a pressure torque. The equilibrium profile of the disk is then set by the balance between gravity, viscous and pressure torques. We check that this balance is satisfied in numerical simulations, with a planet on a fixed circular orbit. We then use a reference numerical simulation to get an ansatz for the pressure torque, that yields gap profiles for any value of the disk viscosity, pressure scale height and planet to primary mass ratio. Those are in good agreement with profiles obtained in numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. Finally, we provide a gap opening criterion that simultaneously involves the planet mass, the disk viscosity and the aspect ratio. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The astrochemistry of the host disc is computed using an ionization-driven, non-equilibrium chemistry network within viscously evolving disc models. We accrete gas giant planets whose orbital evolution is controlled by planet traps using the standard core accretion model and track the chemical composition of the material that is accreted on to the protoplanet. We choose a fiducial disc model and evolve planets in three traps - water ice line, dead zone and heat transition. For a disc with a lifetime of 4.1 Myr, we produce two hot Jupiters (M = 1.43, 2.67 MJupiter, r = 0.15, 0.11 au) in the heat transition and ice line trap and one failed core (M = 0.003 MJupiter, r = 3.7 au) in the dead zone. These planets are found with mixing ratios for CO and H2O of 1.99 \texttimes{} 10-4 and 5.0 \texttimes{} 10-4, respectively, for both hot Jupiters. Additionally, for these planets we find CO2 and CH4, with mixing ratios of 1.8 \texttimes{} 10-6 \textrightarrow{} 9.8 \texttimes{} 10-10 and 1.1 \texttimes{} 10-8 \textrightarrow{} 2.3 \texttimes{} 10-10, respectively. These ranges correspond well with the mixing ratio ranges that have been inferred through the detection of emission spectra from hot Jupiters by multiple authors. We compute a carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 0.227 for the ice line planet and 0.279 for the heat transition planet. These planets accreted their gas inside the ice line, hence the sub-solar C/O.},

We compute evolving radial distributions for a range of dust grain sizes, which depend on coagulation, fragmentation and radial drift processes. In particular, we find that the water ice line plays an important role in shaping the radial distribution of the maximum grain size because ice-coated grains are significantly less susceptible to fragmentation than their dry counterparts. This in turn has important effects on disc ionization and therefore on the location of dead zones. In comparison to a simple constant gas-to-dust ratio model for the dust as an example, we find that the new model predicts an outer dead zone edge that moves in by a factor of about 3 at 1 Myr (to 5 au) and by a factor of about 14 by 3 Myr (to 0.5 au). We show that the changing position of the dead zone and heat transition traps have important implications for the formation and trapping of planets in protoplanetary discs.

We carry out a systematic search for planets by assessing the false alarm probability associated with Keplerian orbit fits to the data.

We show that all planets with orbital periods \textbackslash textless2000 days, velocity amplitudes \textbackslash textgreater20 m/s, and eccentricities \textbackslash textless0.6 have been announced, and summarize the candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of a companion, typically 10 m/s, and use the non-detections to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of planet mass and orbital period, and extrapolate to long period orbits and low planet masses. A power law fit for planet masses \textbackslash textgreater0.3 Jupiter masses and periods \textbackslash textless2000 days gives a mass-period distribution dN=C M\^\$\textbackslash backslash\$alpha P\^\$\textbackslash backslash\$beta dlnM dlnP with \$\textbackslash backslash\$alpha=-0.31 \$\textbackslash backslash\$pm 0.2, \$\textbackslash backslash\$beta=0.26\$\textbackslash backslash\$pm 0.1, and the normalization constant C such that 10.5\% of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3-10 Jupiter masses and orbital period 2-2000 days. The orbital period distribution shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of 5 for orbital periods beyond 300 days. Extrapolation gives 17-20\% of stars having gas giant planets within 20 AU.

  abstract = {Solid material in a protoplanetary nebula is subject to vigorous redistribution processes relative to the nebula gas. Meter-sized particles drift rapidly inwards near the nebula midplane, and material evaporates when the particles cross a condensation/evaporation boundary. The material cannot be removed as fast in its vapor form as it is being supplied in solid form, so its concentration increases locally by a large factor (more than an order of magnitude under nominal conditions). As time goes on, the vapor phase enhancement propagates for long distances inside the evaporation boundary (potentially all the way in to the star). Meanwhile, material is enhanced in its solid form over a characteristic lengthscale outside the evaporation boundary. This effect is applicable to any condensible (water, silicates, \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it etc.\}). Three distinct radial enhancement/depletion regimes can be discerned by use of a simple model. Meteoritics applications include oxygen fugacity and isotopic variations, as well as isotopic homogenization in silicates. Planetary system applications include more robust enhancement of solids in Jupiter's core formation region than previously suggested. Astrophysical applications include differential, time-dependent enhancement of vapor phase CO and H\$\_2\$O in the terrestrial planet regions of actively accreting protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {The \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it Kepler\} mission revealed a population of compact multiple-planet systems with orbital periods shorter than a year, and occasionally even shorter than a day. By analyzing a sample of 102 \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it Kepler\} and \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it K2\} multi-planet systems, we measure the minimum difference \$\textbackslash backslashDelta I\$ between the orbital inclinations, as a function of the orbital distance of the innermost planet. This is accomplished by fitting all the planetary signals simultaneously, constrained by an external estimate of the stellar mean density. We find \$\textbackslash backslashDelta I\$ to be larger when the inner orbit is smaller, a trend that does not appear to be a selection effect. We find that planets with \$a/R\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$\textbackslash textless5 have a dispersion in \$\textbackslash backslashDelta I\$ of \$6.7\textbackslash backslashpm 0.6\${$\sim$}degrees, while planets with \$5 \textbackslash textless a/R\_\textbackslash backslashstar \textbackslash textless 12\$ have a dispersion of \$2.0\textbackslash backslashpm 0.1\${$\sim$}degrees.

  abstract = {While the solar system contains about 20 times more moons than planets, no moon has been confirmed around any of the thousands of extrasolar planets known so far. Tools for an uncomplicated identification of the most promising exomoon candidates could be beneficial to streamline follow-up studies.\vphantom\{\} Here we study three exomoon indicators that emerge if well-established planet-only models are fitted to a planet-moon transit light curve: transit timing variations (TTVs), transit duration variations (TDVs), and apparent planetary transit radius variations (TRVs). We re-evaluate under realistic conditions the previously proposed exomoon signatures in the TTV and TDV series. We simulate light curves of a transiting exoplanet with a single moon. These model light curves are then fitted with a planet-only transit model, pretending there were no moon, and we explore the resulting TTV, TDV, and TRV series for evidence of the moon. The previously described ellipse in the TTV-TDV diagram of an exoplanet with a moon emerges only for high-density moons. Low-density moons distort the sinusoidal shapes of the TTV and the TDV series due to their photometric contribution to the combined planet-moon transit. Sufficiently large moons can produce periodic apparent TRVs of their host planets that could be observable. We find that Kepler and PLATO have similar performances in detecting the exomoon-induced TRV effect around simulated bright (\$m\_V=8\$) stars. These stars, however, are rare in the Kepler sample but will be abundant in the PLATO sample. Moreover, PLATO's higher cadence yields a stronger TTV signal. The periodogram of the sequence of transit radius measurements can indicate the presence of a moon. The TTV and TDV series of exoplanets with moons can be more complex than previously assumed. We propose that TRVs could be a more promising means to identify exomoons in large exoplanet surveys., annote = signs of exomoons in planet-only models.

  abstract = {The dynamical history of stars influences the formation and evolution of planets significantly. To explore the influence of dynamical history on the planet formation and evolution from observations, we assume that it's probable that stars with higher relative velocities experienced significant dynamical events. Utilizing the accurate Gaia-Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog, we select single main-sequence stars and divide these stars into three groups according to their relative velocities, i.e. High-V, Median-V, and Normal-V stars. After considering the known biases from Kepler data and adopting prior and posterior correction to minimize the influence of stellar properties on planet occurrence rate, we find that High-V stars have a lower occurrence rate of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes (1\textendash 4 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$, P\textbackslash textless100 days) and higher occurrence rate of sub-Earth (0.5\textendash 1 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$, P\textbackslash textless2 days) than Normal-V stars. Additionally, we discuss two scenarios to explain the results: "High-V stars with initially lower disk fraction", which works before gas disk dissipation, and "High-V stars with extreme dynamical evolution", which works after gas disk dissipation or the formation of planetary systems. After investigating the multiplicity and eccentricity, we find that High-V planet hosts prefer a higher fraction of multi-planets systems and lower average eccentricity, which is consistent with the eccentricity-multiplicity dichotomy of Kepler planetary systems. Therefore, it supports the first scenario. In the future, with data release from Gaia, TESS, and PLATO, more planets can be used to test our statistical results and check different scenarios.},

The disk is assumed steady and geometrically thin. The turbulent viscosity coefficient is expressed using the alpha prescription and the main heating mechanisms considered are viscous dissipation and irradiation by the central star. The energy is transported by radiation, turbulent conduction and convection. We find that irradiation from the central star is the main heating agent of the disk, except in the innermost regions, R less than 2 AU. The irradiation increases the temperature of the outer disk relative to the purely viscous case. As a consequence, the outer disk (R larger than 5 AU) becomes less dense, optically thin and almost vertically isothermal, with a temperature distribution T proportional to R\^\{-1/2\}. The decrease in surface density at the outer disk, decreases the disk mass by a factor of 4 respect to a purely viscous case. In addition, irradiation tends to make the outer disk regions stable against gravitational instabilities.},

The theoretical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images for all inclinations are compared with observations of the entire population of Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and Class I objects in Taurus. In particular, we find that the median near-infrared fluxes can be explained within the errors with the most recent values for the median accretion rates for CTTS. We further show that the majority of the Class I sources in Taurus cannot be Class II sources viewed edge-on because they are too luminous and their colors would be consistent with disks seen only in a narrow range of inclinations. Our models appear to be too geometrically thick at large radii, as suggested by: (a) larger far-infrared disk emission than in the typical SEDs of T Tauri stars; (b) wider dark dust lanes in the model images than in the images of HH30 and HK Tau/c; and (c) larger predicted number of stars extincted by edge-on disks than consistent with current surveys. The large thickness of the model is a consequence of the assumption that dust and gas are well-mixed, suggesting that some degree of dust settling may be required to explain the observations.},

By using extensive simulations based on a quasi-periodic representation of the stellar activity component, we investigate the ability in retrieving the planetary parameters in 16 different realistic scenarios. We analyse systems composed by one planet and host stars having different levels of activity, focusing on the challenging case represented by low-mass planets, with Doppler semi-amplitudes in the range 1-3 \$m s\^\{-1\}\$. We consider many different configurations for the quasi-periodic stellar activity component, as well as different combinations of the observing epochs. We use commonly-employed analysis tools to search for and characterize the planetary signals in the datasets. The goal of our injection-recovery statistical analysis is twofold. First, we focus on the problem of planet mass determination. Then, we analyse in a statistical way periodograms obtained with three different algorithms, in order to explore some of their general properties, as the completeness and reliability in retrieving the injected planetary and stellar activity signals with low false alarm probabilities. This work is intended to provide some understanding of the biases introduced in the planet parameters inferred from the analysis of radial velocity time series that contain correlated signals due to stellar activity. It also aims to motivate the use and encourage the improvement of extensive simulations for planning spectroscopic follow-up observations.},

We consider a range of planetary masses extending from one and a half Earth's masses up to one Jupiter's mass, and we take into account physically realistic gravitational potentials of forming planets. In order to calculate accurately the gravitational torques exerted by disk material and to investigate the accretion process onto the planet, the flow dynamics has to be thoroughly resolved on long as well as short length scales. We achieve this strict resolution requirement by applying a nested-grid refinement technique which allows to greatly enhance the local resolution. Our results from altogether 51 simulations show that for large planetary masses, approximately above a tenth of the Jupiter's mass, migration rates are relatively constant, as expected in type II migration regime and in good agreement with previous two-dimensional calculations. In a range between seven and fifteen Earth's masses, we find a dependency of the migration speed on the planetary mass that yields time scales considerably longer than those predicted by linear analytical theories. This property may be important in determining the overall orbital evolution of protoplanets. The growth time scale is minimum around twenty Earth-masses, but it rapidly increases for both smaller and larger mass values. Significant differences between two- and three-dimensional calculations are found in particular for objects with masses smaller than ten Earth-masses. We also derive an analytical approximation for the numerically computed mass growth rates.},

  abstract = {We analyze the orbital and mass evolution of planets that undergo run-away gas accretion by means of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations. The disk torque distribution per unit disk mass as a function of radius provides an important diagnostic for the nature of the disk-planet interactions. We first consider torque distributions for nonmigrating planets of fixed mass and show that there is general agreement with the expectations of resonance theory. We then present results of simulations for mass-gaining, migrating planets. For planets with an initial mass of 5 Earth masses, which are embedded in disks with standard parameters and which undergo run-away gas accretion to one Jupiter mass (Mjup), the torque distributions per unit disk mass are largely unaffected by migration and accretion for a given planet mass. The migration rates for these planets are in agreement with the predictions of the standard theory for planet migration (Type I and Type II migration). The planet mass growth occurs through gas capture within the planet's Bondi radius at lower planet masses, the Hill radius at intermediate planet masses, and through reduced accretion at higher planet masses due to gap formation. During run-away mass growth, a planet migrates inwards by only about 20\% in radius before achieving a mass of {$\sim$}1 Mjup. For the above models, we find no evidence of fast migration driven by coorbital torques, known as Type III migration. We do find evidence of Type III migration for a fixed mass planet of Saturn's mass that is immersed in a cold and massive disk. In this case the planet migration is assumed to begin before gap formation completes. The migration is understood through a model in which the torque is due to an asymmetry in density between trapped gas on the leading side of the planet and ambient gas on the trailing side of the planet.},

In this context, we develop a population synthesis code in the pebble accretion scenario, to analyse the disk mass dependence on planet formation around low mass stars. We base our model on the analytical sequential model presented in Ormel et al. (2017) and analyse the populations resulting from varying initial disk mass distributions. Starting out with seeds the mass of Ceres near the ice-line formed by streaming instability, we grow the planets using the Pebble Accretion process and migrate them inwards using Type-I migration. The next planets are formed sequentially after the previous planet crosses the ice-line. We explore different initial distributions of disk masses to show the dependence of this parameter with the final planetary population. Our results show that compact close-in resonant systems can be pretty common around M-dwarfs between 0.09-0.2 M{$\odot$} only when the disks considered are more massive than what is being observed by sub-mm disk surveys. The minimum disk mass to form a Mars-like planet is found to be about 2 \texttimes{} 10-3M{$\odot$}. Small variation in the disk mass distribution also manifest in the simulated planet distribution. The paradox of disk masses might be caused by an underestimation of the disk masses in observations, by a rapid depletion of mass in disks by planets growing within a million years or by deficiencies in our current planet formation picture.},

Such an evolutionary phenomenon should depend on the age of the star-planet system. In this work, we study the temporal evolution of the radius valley using two independent determinations of host star ages among the California\textendash Kepler Survey (CKS) sample. We find evidence for a wide and nearly empty void of planets in the period-radius diagram at the youngest system ages (\$\textbackslash backslashlesssim\$2\textendash 3 Gyr) represented in the CKS sample. At older system ages the radius valley appears progressively more filled in. We show that the orbital period dependence of the radius valley among the younger CKS planets is consistent with that found among those planets with asteroseismically determined host star radii. While the slopes are consistent, the radius valley determined among the younger planetary sample is shifted to smaller radii, compatible with an atmospheric loss timescale on the order of gigayears for the largest and most massive planetary cores. Our results suggest that the radius valley may be a transient feature in the radius distribution of exoplanets, being weaker among older planet populations.},

We begin by discussing the planet-planet interactions that take place within our own Solar System. We then describe such interactions in more tightly-packed planetary systems. As planet-planet interactions build up, some systems become dynamically unstable, leading to strong encounters and ultimately either ejections or collisions of planets. After discussing the basic physical processes involved, we consider how these interactions apply to extrasolar planetary systems and explore the constraints provided by observed systems. The presence of a residual planetesimal disc can lead to planetary migration and hence cause instabilities induced by resonance crossing; however, such discs can also stabilise planetary systems. The crowded birth environment of a planetary system can have a significant impact: close encounters and binary companions can act to destabilise systems, or sculpt their properties. In the case of binaries, the Kozai mechanism can place planets on extremely eccentric orbits which may later circularise to produce hot Jupiters.},

  abstract = {The distribution of eccentricities of warm giant exoplanets is commonly explained through planet\textendash planet interactions, although no physically sound argument favours the ubiquity of such interactions. No simple, generic explanation has been put forward to explain the high mean eccentricity of these planets. In this paper, we revisit a simple, plausible explanation to account for the eccentricities of warm Jupiters: migration inside a cavity in the protoplanetary disc. Such a scenario allows to excite the outer eccentric resonances, a working mechanism for higher mass planets, leading to a growth in the eccentricity while preventing other, closer resonances to damp eccentricity. We test this idea with diverse numerical simulations, which show that the eccentricity of a Jupiter-mass planet around a Sun-like star can increase up to {$\sim$}0.4, a value never reached before with solely planet\textendash disc interactions. This high eccentricity is comparable to, if not larger than, the median eccentricity of warm Saturn- to Jupiter-mass exoplanets. We also discuss the effects such a mechanism would have on exoplanet observations. This scenario could have strong consequences on the discs lifetime and the physics of inner disc dispersal, which could be constrained by the eccentricity distribution of gas giants.},

  abstract = {The young (50-400 Myr) A3V star \$\textbackslash backslashbeta\$ Leo is a primary target to study the formation history and evolution of extrasolar planetary systems as one of the few stars with known hot (\$\textbackslash backslashsim\$1600\$\^\textbackslash backslashcirc\$K), warm (\$\textbackslash backslashsim\$600\$\^\textbackslash backslashcirc\$K), and cold (\$\textbackslash backslashsim\$120\$\^\textbackslash backslashcirc\$K) dust belt components. In this paper, we present deep mid-infrared measurements of the warm dust brightness obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) as part of its exozodiacal dust survey (HOSTS). The measured excess is 0.47\$\textbackslash backslash\$\%\$\textbackslash backslashpm\$0.050\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% within the central 1.5 au, rising to 0.81\$\textbackslash backslash\$\%\$\textbackslash backslashpm\$0.026\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% within 4.5 au, outside the habitable zone of \$\textbackslash backslashbeta\${$\sim$}Leo. This dust level is 50 \$\textbackslash backslashpm\$ 10 times greater than in the solar system's zodiacal cloud. Poynting-Robertson drag on the cold dust detected by Spitzer and Herschel under-predicts the dust present in the habitable zone of \$\textbackslash backslashbeta\${$\sim$}Leo, suggesting an additional delivery mechanism (e.g.,{$\sim$}comets) or an additional belt at \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$5.5 au. A model of these dust components is provided which implies the absence of planets more than a few Saturn masses between \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$5 au and the outer belt at \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$40 au. We also observationally constrain giant planets with the LBTI imaging channel at 3.8{$\sim\$\backslash$}backslashmu\$m wavelength. Assuming an age of 50 Myr, any planet in the system between approximately 5 au to 50 au must be less than a few Jupiter masses, consistent with our dust model. Taken together, these observations showcase the deep contrasts and detection capabilities attainable by the LBTI for both warm exozodiacal dust and giant exoplanets in or near the habitable zone of nearby stars.},

The discovery and characterization of the first very massive transiting planetary companion with a short orbital period is reported.Methods. A series of 34 transits was detected in the CoRoT light curve of an F3V star, observed from May to October 2007 for 152 days. The radius was accurately determined and the mass derived for this new transiting, thanks to the combined analysis of the light curve and complementary ground-based observations: high-precision radial-velocity measurements, on-off photometry, and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations.Results. CoRoT-Exo-3b has a radius of 1.01 {$\pm$} 0.07Jup and transits around its F3-type primary every 4.26 days in a synchronous orbit. Its mass of 21.66 {$\pm$} 1.0 MJup, density of 26.4 {$\pm$} 5.6 g cm-3, and surface gravity of log g = 4.72 clearly distinguish it from the regular close-in planet population, making it the most intriguing transiting substellar object discovered so far. Conclusions. With the current data, the nature of CoRoT-Exo-3b is ambiguous, as it could either be a low-mass brown-dwarf or a member of a new class of "superplanets". Its discovery may help constrain the evolution of close-in planets and brown-dwarfs better. Finally, CoRoT-Exo-3b confirms the trend that massive transiting giant planets (M {$\geq$} 4 MJup) are found preferentially around more massive stars than the Sun. \textcopyright{} 2008 ESO.},

These methods have a high computational cost, especially for low FAP levels, which are of most interest. We present an analytical estimate of the FAP of the periodogram in the presence of correlated noise, which is fundamental to analyze astronomical time series correctly. The analytical estimate that we derive provides a very good approximation of the FAP at a much lower cost than numerical methods. We validate our analytical approach by comparing it with Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of the method to different assumptions in the modeling of the noise.},

The theoretical interpretation of these new observational results requires updated evolutionary models and isochrones spanning a wide range of chemical composition. With this aim we built the new "Pisa Stellar Evolution Database" of stellar models and isochrones by adopting a well-tested evolutionary code (FRANEC) implemented with updated physical and chemical inputs. In particular, our code adopts realistic atmosphere models and an updated equation of state, nuclear reaction rates and opacities calculated with recent solar elements mixture. A total of 32646 models have been computed in the range of initial masses 0.30 - 1.10 Msun for a grid of 216 chemical compositions with the fractional metal abundance in mass, Z, ranging from 0.0001 to 0.01, and the original helium content, Y, from 0.25 to 0.42. Models were computed for both solar-scaled and alpha-enhanced abundances with different external convection efficiencies. Correspondingly, 9720 isochrones were computed in the age range 8 - 15 Gyr, in time steps of 0.5 Gyr. The whole database is available to the scientific community on the web. Models and isochrones were compared with recent calculations available in the literature and with the color-magnitude diagram of selected Galactic globular clusters. The dependence of relevant evolutionary quantities on the chemical composition and convection efficiency were analyzed in a quantitative statistical way and analytical formulations were made available for reader's convenience.},

Radial velocity surveys thus have a key role to play, in particular for giant planets. Cold Jupiters induce a typical radial velocity semi-amplitude of 10m.s\^\{-1\}, which is well within the reach of multiple instruments that have now been in operation for more than a decade. Aims. We take advantage of the ongoing radial velocity survey with the sophie high-resolution spectrograph, which continues the search started by its predecessor elodie to further characterize the cold Jupiter population. Methods. Analyzing the radial velocity data from six bright solar-like stars taken over a period of up to 15 years, we attempt the detection and confirmation of Keplerian signals. Results. We announce the discovery of six planets, one per system, with minimum masses in the range 2.99-8.3 Mjup and orbital periods between 200 days and 10 years. The data do not provide enough evidence to support the presence of additional planets in any of these systems. The analysis of stellar activity indicators confirms the planetary nature of the detected signals. Conclusions. These six planets belong to the cold and massive Jupiter population, and four of them populate its eccentric tail. In this respect, HD 80869 b stands out as having one of the most eccentric orbits, with an eccentricity of 0.862\^\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.018\}. These planets can thus help to better constrain the migration and evolution processes at play in the gas giant population. Furthermore, recent works presenting the correlation between small planets and cold Jupiters indicate that these systems are good candidates to search for small inner planets.},

The efficiency of the planet formation can be defined by the mass ratio between formed protoplanets and the initial mass of embryos and planetesimals. In final assembly planet formation models, the gravitational interactions between planetesimals are usually neglected due to computational difficulties, namely, computations require fewer resources in this way. We investigated the effect of this simplification via modeling the planet formation efficiency in a circumstellar belt of embryos and self-interacting or non-self-interacting planetesimals. We used our own developed GPU-based direct N-body integrator, HIPERION, for the simulations. We found that planet formation efficiency is higher if the planetesimal self-interaction is taken into account in models that contain the commonly used 100 embryos. The observed effect can be explained by the damping of planetesimal eccentricities by their self-gravity. The non-self-interacting and self-interacting models show qualitatively the same results if the initial number of embryos is above 200.},

  abstract = {Intermediate mass planets, from Super-Earth to Neptune-sized bodies, are the most common type of planets in the galaxy. The prevailing theory of planet formation, core-accretion, predicts significantly fewer intermediate-mass giant planets than observed. The competing mechanism for planet formation, disk instability, can produce massive gas giant planets on wide-orbits, such as HR8799, by direct fragmentation of the protoplanetary disk. Previously, fragmentation in magnetized protoplanetary disks has only been considered when the magneto-rotational instability is the driving mechanism for magnetic field growth. Yet, this instability is naturally superseded by the spiral-driven dynamo when more realistic, non-ideal MHD conditions are considered. Here we report on MHD simulations of disk fragmentation in the presence of a spiral-driven dynamo. Fragmentation leads to the formation of long-lived bound protoplanets with masses that are at least one order of magnitude smaller than in conventional disk instability models. These light clumps survive shear and do not grow further due to the shielding effect of the magnetic field, whereby magnetic pressure stifles local inflow of matter. The outcome is a population of gaseous-rich planets with intermediate masses, while gas giants are found to be rarer, in qualitative agreement with the observed mass distribution of exoplanets.},

This early sample composed of 150 stars is used to perform a preliminary statistical analysis of the SHINE data, deferred to two companion papers presenting the survey performance, main discoveries, and the preliminary statistical constraints set by SHINE. Based on a large database collecting the stellar properties of all young nearby stars in the solar vicinity (including kinematics, membership to moving groups, isochrones, lithium abundance, rotation, and activity), we selected the original sample of 800 stars that were ranked in order of priority according to their sensitivity for planet detection in direct imaging with SPHERE.

  abstract = {Context. Mapping distant worlds is the next frontier for exoplanet infrared (IR) photometry studies. Ultimately, constraining spatial and temporal properties of an exoplanet atmosphere (e.g., its temperature) will provide further insight into its physics. For tidallylocked hot Jupiters that transit and are eclipsed by their host star, the first steps are now possible. Aims. Our aim is to constrain an exoplanets (1) shape, (2) brightness distribution (BD) and (3) system parameters from its phase curve and eclipse measurements. In particular, we rely on the secondary-eclipse scanning which is obtained while an exoplanet is gradually masked by its host star. Methods. We use archived Spitzer/IRAC 8-m data of HD189733 (six transits, eight secondary eclipses, and a phase curve) in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for mitigating systematics. We also include HD189733s out-of-transit radial velocity (RV) measurements to assess their incidence on the inferences obtained solely from the photometry. Results. We find a 6 deviation from the expected occultation of a uniformly-bright disk. This deviation emerges mainly from a large-scale hot spot in HD189733bs atmosphere, not from HD189733bs shape. We indicate that the correlation of the exoplanet orbital eccentricity, e, and BD (uniform time offset) does also depend on the stellar density, ?, and the exoplanet impact parameter, b (e-b-?-BD correlation). For HD189733b, we find that relaxing the eccentricity constraint and using more complex BDs lead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized and latitudinally-shifted hot spot. We, therefore, show that the light curve of an exoplanet does not constrain uniquely its brightness peak localization. Finally, we obtain an improved constraint on the upper limit of HD189733bs orbital eccentricity, e 0:011 (95\% confidence), when including HD189733s RV measurements. Conclusions. Reanalysis of archived HD189733s data constrains HD189733bs shape and BD at 8 m. Our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curves and a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. In particular, observations of the same exoplanet at different wavelengths could improve the constraints on HD189733s system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3D map of HD189733bs atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the perspective of extending our method to observations in the visible (e.g., Kepler data), in particular to better understand exoplanet albedos. \textcopyright{} ESO 2012.},

The model considers both transiting and non-transiting planets, and can test the addition of more than one planet. Our tests show the model's orbital period predictions are robust to perturbations in system architectures on the order of a few percent, much larger than current uncertainties. Applying it to the multi-planet systems from TESS provides a prioritized list of targets, based on predicted transit depth and probability, for archival searches and for guiding ground-based follow-up observations hunting for hidden planets.},

  abstract = {tau Ceti is the closest single Sun-like star to the solar system and hosts a multi-planet system with four confirmed planets. The possible presence of additional planets, especially potentially habitable worlds, remains of great interest. We analyze the structure of the tau Ceti planetary system via the DYNAMITE algorithm, combining information from exoplanet population statistics and orbital dynamics with measurements of this specific system. We also expand DYNAMITE to incorporate radial velocity information. Our analysis suggests the presence of four additional planets, three of which match closely with the periods of three tentative planet candidates reported previously. We also predict at least one more planet candidate with an orbital period between \$\textbackslash backslashsim270-470\$ days, in the habitable zone for tau Ceti. Based on the measured \$m \textbackslash backslashsin i\$ values of the confirmed planets, we also assess the possible masses and nature of the detected and undetected planets. The least massive planets and candidates are likely to be rocky, while the other planets and candidates could either be rocky or contain a significant gaseous envelope. The RV observable signature from the predicted habitable zone planet candidate would likely be at or just above the noise level in current data, but should be detectable in future extremely high-precision radial velocity and direct imaging studies.},

  abstract = {A stunning range of substructures in the dust of protoplanetary disks is routinely observed across a range of wavelengths. These gaps, rings and spirals are highly indicative of a population of unseen planets, hinting at the possibility of current observational facilities being able to capture planet-formation in action. Over the last decade, our understanding of the influence of a young planet on the dynamical structure of its parental disk has progressed significantly, revealing a host of potentially observable features which would betray the presence of a deeply embedded planet. In concert, recent observations have shown that subtle perturbations in the kinematic structure of protoplanetary disks are found in multiple sources, potentially the characteristic disturbances associated with embedded planets. In this work, we review the theoretical background of planet-disk interactions, focusing on the kinematical features, and the current methodologies used to observe these interactions in spatially and spectrally resolved observations. We discuss the potential pit falls of such kinematical detections of planets, providing best-practices for imaging and analysing interferometric data, along with a set of criteria to use as a benchmark for any claimed detection of embedded planets. We finish with a discussion on the current state of simulations in regard to planet-disk interactions, highlighting areas of particular interest and future directions which will provide the most significant impact in our search for embedded planets. This work is the culmination of the 'Visualizing the Kinematics of Planet Formation' workshop, held in October 2019 at the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City.},

  abstract = {Context. Several recent studies have found that planet migration in adiabatic disks differs significantly from migration in isothermal disks. Depending on the thermodynamic conditions, that is, the effectiveness of radiative cooling, and on the radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. Clearly, this will influence the semimajor-axis-to-mass distribution of planets predicted by population-synthesis simulations. Aims. Our goal is to study the global effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation, gap opening, and stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic planet population. Methods. We combined results from several analytical studies and 3D hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for the application in our planet population synthesis calculations. Results. We find a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations. A typical disk has three convergence zones to which migrating planets move from the in- and outside. This strongly affects the migration behavior of low-mass planets. Interestingly, this leads to a slow type II like migration behavior for low-mass planets captured in these zones even without an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet-to-be-defined halting mechanism. This means that the new prescription of migration that includes nonisothermal effects makes the previously widely used artificial migration rate reduction factor obsolete. Conclusions. Outward migration in parts of a disk helps some planets to survive long enough to become massive. The convergence zones lead to potentially observable accumulations of low-mass planets at certain semimajor axes. Our results indicate that more studies of the mass at which the corotation torque saturates are needed since its value has a main impact on the properties of planet populations. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2014.},

  abstract = {We combine all available information to constrain the nature of OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the first in a high-magnification event. These include photometric and astrometric measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as constraints from higher order effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlens parallax, planetary orbital motion, and finite-source effects. Our primary analysis leads to the conclusion that the host of Jovian planet OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is an M dwarf in the foreground disk with mass M = 0.46 {$\pm$} 0.04 M{$\odot$}, distance Dl = 3.2 {$\pm$} 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics {$\nu$}LSR {$\sim$} 103 km s-1. From the best-fit model, the planet has mass Mp = 3.8 {$\pm$} 0.4 MJupiter, lies at a projected separation r{$\perp$} = 3.6 {$\pm$} 0.2AU from its host, and so has an equilibrium temperature of T {$\sim$} 55 K, that is, similar to Neptune. A degenerate model gives similar planetary mass Mp = 3.4 {$\pm$} 0.4 MJupiter with a smaller projected separation, r{$\perp$} = 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.1AU, and higher equilibrium temperature, T {$\sim$} 71 K. These results from the primary analysis suggest that OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered that is hosted by an M dwarf. However, the formation of such high-mass planetary companions in the outer regions of M dwarf planetary systems is predicted to be unlikely within the core-accretion scenario. There are a number of caveats to this primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) that the unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, that is, the planetary host. However, these caveats could mostly be resolved by a single astrometric measurement a few years after the event.},

It is currently debated whether Warm Jupiters form in situ, undergo disk or high eccentricity tidal migration, or have a mixture of origin channels. These different classes of origin channels lead to different expectations for Warm Jupiters' properties, which are currently difficult to evaluate due to the small sample size. We take advantage of the \$\textbackslash backslash\$TESS survey and systematically search for Warm Jupiter candidates around main-sequence host stars brighter than the \$\textbackslash backslash\$TESS-band magnitude of 12 in the Full-Frame Images in Year 1 of the \$\textbackslash backslash\$TESS Prime Mission data. We introduce a catalog of 55 Warm Jupiter candidates, including 19 candidates that were not originally released as \$\textbackslash backslash\$TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) by the \$\textbackslash backslash\$TESS team. We fit their \$\textbackslash backslash\$TESS light curves, characterize their eccentricities and transit-timing variations (TTVs), and prioritize a list for ground-based follow-up and \$\textbackslash backslash\$TESS Extended Mission observations. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we find the preliminary eccentricity distributions of our Warm-Jupiter-candidate catalog using a Beta distribution, a Rayleigh distribution, and a two-component Gaussian distribution as the functional forms of the eccentricity distribution. Additional follow-up observations will be required to clean the sample of false positives for a full statistical study, derive the orbital solutions to break the eccentricity degeneracy, and provide mass measurements.},

At the same time, observational studies suggest that planetesimal formation should start early, possibly even before the protoplanetary disk is fully formed. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions planetesimals already form during the disk buildup stage, in which gas and dust fall onto the disk from its parent molecular cloud. We couple our earlier planetesimal formation model at the water snow line to a simple model of disk formation and evolution. We find that under most conditions planetesimals only form after the buildup stage when the disk becomes less massive and less hot. However, there are parameters for which planetesimals already form during the disk buildup. This occurs when the viscosity driving the disk evolution is intermediate (\$\textbackslash backslashalpha\_v \textbackslash backslashsim 10\^\{-3\}-10\^\{-2\}\$) while the turbulent mixing of the dust is reduced compared to that (\$\textbackslash backslashalpha\_t \textbackslash backslashlesssim 10\^\{-4\}\$), and with the assumption that water vapor is vertically well-mixed with the gas. Such \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\_t \textbackslash backslashll \textbackslash backslashalpha\_v\$ scenario could be expected for layered accretion, where the gas flow is mostly driven by the active surface layers, while the midplane layers, where most of the dust resides, are quiescent.},

We aim to derive the pebble sizes and fluxes from state-of-the-art dust coagulation models and to understand their dependence on disk parameters and the fragmentation threshold velocity, and the impact of those on planetary growth by pebble accretion. Methods. We used a 1D dust evolution model including dust growth and fragmentation to calculate realistic pebble sizes and mass flux. We used this information to integrate the growth of planetary embryos placed at various locations in the protoplanetary disk. Results. Pebble flux strongly depends on disk properties including size and turbulence level, as well as the dust aggregates' fragmentation threshold. We find that dust fragmentation may be beneficial to planetary growth in multiple ways. First of all, it prevents the solids from growing to very large sizes, at which point the efficiency of pebble accretion drops. What is more, small pebbles are depleted at a lower rate, providing a long-lasting pebble flux. As the full coagulation models are computationally expensive, we provide a simple method of estimating pebble sizes and flux in any protoplanetary disk model without substructure and with any fragmentation threshold velocity.},

The late-stage planet accretion models typically make arbitrary assumptions about planetesimals and pebbles distribution while the dust evolution models predict that planetesimal formation is only possible at some orbital distances. Aims. We want to test the importance of water snow line for triggering formation of the first planetesimals during the gas-rich phase of protoplanetary disk, when cores of giant planets have to form. Methods. We connect prescriptions for gas disk evolution, dust growth and fragmentation, water ice evaporation and recondensation, as well as transport of both solids and water vapor, and planetesimal formation via streaming instability into a single, one-dimensional model for protoplanetary disk evolution. Results. We find that processes taking place around the snow line facilitate planetesimal formation in two ways. First, due to the change of sticking properties between wet and dry aggregates, there is a "traffic jam"inside of the snow line that slows down the fall of solids onto the star. Second, ice evaporation and outward diffusion of water followed by its recondensation increases the abundance of icy pebbles that trigger planetesimal formation via streaming instability just outside of the snow line. Conclusions. Planetesimal formation is hindered by growth barriers and radial drift and thus requires particular conditions to take place. Snow line is a favorable location where planetesimal formation is possible for a wide range of conditions, but still not in every protoplanetary disk model. This process is particularly promoted in large, cool disks with low intrinsic turbulence and increased initial dust-to-gas ratio.},

This is primarily caused by so-called growth barriers: the direct growth of larger bodies is halted at centimetre-sized objects and particular conditions are required for the formation of larger, gravitationally bound planetesimals. Aims. We aim to connect models of dust evolution and planetesimal formation to identify regions of protoplanetary discs that are favourable for the formation of kilometre-sized bodies and the first planetary embryos. Methods. We combine semi-analytical models of viscous protoplanetary disc evolution, dust growth and drift including backreaction of the dust particles on the gas, and planetesimal formation via the streaming instability into one numerical code. We investigate how planetesimal formation is affected by the mass of the protoplanetary disc, its initial dust content, and the stickiness of dust aggregates. Results. We find that the dust growth and drift leads to a global redistribution of solids. The pile-up of pebbles in the inner disc provides local conditions where the streaming instability is effective. Planetesimals form in an annulus with its inner edge lying between 0.3 AU and 1 AU and its width ranging from 0.3 AU to 3 AU. The resulting surface density of planetesimals follows a radial profile that is much steeper than the initial disc profile. These results support formation of terrestrial planets in the solar system from a narrow annulus of planetesimals, which reproduces their peculiar mass ratios.},

In particular, planetary systems in the solar neighbourhood are interesting and suitable for precise characterization. The RedDots campaigns seek to discover rocky planets orbiting nearby low-mass stars. The 2018 campaign targeted GJ 1061, which is the 20th nearest star to the Sun. For three consecutive months we obtained nightly, high-precision radial velocity measurements with the HARPS spectrograph. We analysed these data together with archival HARPS data.We report the detection of three planet candidates with periods of 3.204{$\pm$}0.001, 6.689 {$\pm$} 0.005, and 13.03 {$\pm$} 0.03 d, which are close to 1:2:4 period commensurability. After several considerations related to the properties of the noise and sampling, we conclude that a fourth signal is most likely explained by stellar rotation, although it may be due to a planet. The proposed three-planet system (and the potential four-planet solution) is long-term dynamically stable. Planet-planet gravitational interactions are below our current detection threshold. The minimum masses of the three planets range from 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 to 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.3M{$\oplus$}. Planet d, with msin i = 1.64 {$\pm$} 0.24M{$\oplus$}, receives a similar amount of energy as Earth receives from the Sun. Consequently it lies within the liquid-water habitable zone of the star and has a similar equilibrium temperature to Earth. GJ 1061 has very similar properties to Proxima Centauri but activity indices point to lower levels of stellar activity.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a Neptune-like planet (LP 714-47 b, P = 4.05204 d, m\_b = 30.8 +/- 1.5 M\_earth , R\_b = 4.7 +/- 0.3 R\_earth ) located in the 'hot Neptune desert'. Confirmation of the TESS Object of Interest (TOI 442.01) was achieved with radial-velocity follow-up using CARMENES, ESPRESSO, HIRES, iSHELL, and PFS, as well as from photometric data using TESS, Spitzer, and ground-based photometry from MuSCAT2, TRAPPIST- South, MONET-South, the George Mason University telescope, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope network, the El Sauce telescope, the TUBITAK National Observatory, the University of Louisville Manner Telescope, and WASP-South. We also present high-spatial resolution adaptive optics imaging with the Gemini Near-Infrared Imager. The low uncertainties in the mass and radius determination place LP 714-47 b among physically well-characterised planets, allowing for a meaningful comparison with planet structure models. The host star LP 714-47 is a slowly rotating early M dwarf (T\_eff = 3950 +/- 51 K) with a mass of 0.59 +/- 0.02 M\_sun and a radius of 0.58 +/- 0.02 R\_sun. From long-term photometric monitoring and spectroscopic activity indicators, we determine a stellar rotation period of about 33 d. The stellar activity is also manifested as correlated noise in the radial-velocity data. In the power spectrum of the radial-velocity data, we detect a second signal with a period of 16 days in addition to the four-day signal of the planet. This could be shown to be a harmonic of the stellar rotation period or the signal of a second planet. It may be possible to tell the difference once more TESS data and radial-velocity data are obtained.},

  abstract = {We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find 0.56 -0.05+0.06 Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R{$\oplus$}) and 0.46 -0.05+0.07 super-Earths (1.5-2 R{$\oplus$}) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R{$\oplus$} and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of 0.16 -0.07+0.17 Earth-size planets and 0.12 -0.05+0.10 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of 0.24 -0.08+0.18 Earth-size planets and 0.21 -0.06+0.11 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 {$\pm$} 0.4 pc and 10.6 -1.8+1.6 pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.2 pc and 8.6 -0.8+0.7 pc.},

  abstract = {Context. The detection of small mass planets with the radial-velocity technique is now confronted with the interference of stellar noise. HARPS can now reach a precision below the meter-per-second, which corresponds to the amplitudes of different stellar perturbations, such as oscillation, granulation, and activity. Aims. Solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noise of a few meter-per-second. The aim of this paper is to simulate this activity and calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies. Methods. Based on Sun observations, we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on the surface of a rotating star. We then calculate the radial-velocity effect induced by these spot groups as a function of time. Taking into account oscillation, granulation, activity, and a HARPS instrumental error of 80-1, we simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order to efficiently reduce all sources of noise. Results. Applying three measurements per night of 10 min every three days, 10 nights a month seems the best tested strategy. Depending on the level of activity considered, from log R{${'}$}HK = - 5 to - 4.75, this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2.5 to 3.5 M{$\oplus$} in the habitable zone of a K1V dwarf. Using Bern's model of planetary formation, we estimate that for the same range of activity level, 15 to 35\% of the planets between 1 and 5 M{$\oplus$} and with a period between 100 and 200 days should be found with HARPS. A comparison between the performance of HARPS and ESPRESSO is also emphasized by our simulations. Using the same optimized strategy, ESPRESSO could find 1.3 M{$\oplus$} planets in the habitable zone of K dwarfs. In addition, 80\% of planets with mass between 1 and 5 M{$\oplus$} and with a period between 100 and 200 days could be detected. \textcopyright{} 2011 ESO.},

  abstract = {Aims. Most studies concerning the growth and evolution of massive planets focus either on their accretion or their migration only. In this work we study both processes concurrently to investigate how they might mutually affect one another. Methods. We modeled a two-dimensional disk with a steady accretion flow onto the central star and embedded a Jupiter mass planet at 5.2 au. The disk is locally isothermal and viscosity is modeled using a constant {$\alpha$}. The planet is held on a fixed orbit for a few hundred orbits to allow the disk to adapt and carve a gap. After this period, the planet is released and free to move according to the gravitational interaction with the gas disk. The mass accretion onto the planet is modeled by removing a fraction of gas from the inner Hill sphere, and the removed mass and momentum can be added to the planet. Results. Our results show that a fast migrating planet is able to accrete more gas than a slower migrating planet. Utilizing a tracer fluid we analyzed the origin of the accreted gas originating predominantly from the inner disk for a fast migrating planet. In the case of slower migration, the fraction of gas from the outer disk increases. We also found that even for very high accretion rates, in some cases gas crosses the planetary gap from the inner to the outer disk. Our simulations show that the crossing of gas changes during the migration process as the migration rate slows down. Therefore, classical type II migration where the planet migrates with the viscous drift rate and no gas crosses the gap is no general process but may only occur for special parameters and at a certain time during the orbital evolution of the planet.},

We describe in detail how our code works and outline ways in which the code can be extended to include additional effects or generalized for the characterization of other data sets \textendash{} including non-planetary data sets. We discuss the pros and cons of several common ways to parameterize eccentricity, highlight a subtle mistake in the implementation of MCMC that could bias the inferred eccentricity of intrinsically circular orbits to significantly non-zero results, discuss a problem with IDL's built-in random number generator in its application to large MCMC fits, and derive a method to analytically fit the linear and quadratic limb darkening coefficients of a planetary transit. Finally, we explain how we achieved improved accuracy and over a factor of 100 improvement in the execution time of the transit model calculation.

Our analysis leads relatively simply to a closed set of equations, valid for arbitrary inclination of the stellar spin to the orbit. The results are equivalent to classical results based on the rather less clear principle that the tidal bulge lags behind the line of centres by some time determined by the rate of dissipation; our analysis gives the effective lag time as a function of the dissipation rate and the quadrupole moment.

Nearly contemporaneous near-IR adaptive optics imaging photometry, optical photometry, and high-dispersion optical spectroscopy are used to distinguish contributions from the inner disks and central stars in the interferometric observations. In addition, the spectroscopic and photometric data provide estimates of stellar properties, mass accretion rates, and disk corotation radii. We model our interferometric and photometric data in the context of geometrically flat accretion disk models with inner holes, and flared disks with puffed-up inner walls. Models incorporating puffed-up inner disk walls generally provide better fits to the data, similar to previous results for higher mass Herbig Ae stars. Our measured inner disk sizes are larger than disk truncation radii predicted by magnetospheric accretion models, with larger discrepancies for sources with higher mass accretion rates. We suggest that our measured sizes correspond to dust sublimation radii, and that optically thin gaseous material may extend farther inward to the magnetospheric truncation radii. Finally, our inner disk measurements constrain the location of terrestrial planet formation as well as potential mechanisms for halting giant planet migration.},

In all sources, we find the gaseous emission to be more compact than or distributed on similar spatial scales to the dust emission. We attempt to fit the data with models including both dust and Br{$\gamma$} -emitting gas, and we consider both disk and infall/outflow morphologies for the gaseous matter.

  abstract = {Aims. We study the dynamics and growth of dust particles in circumstellar disks of different masses that are prone to gravitational instability during the critical first Myr of their evolution. Methods. We solved the hydrodynamics equations for a self-gravitating and viscous circumstellar disk in a thin-disk limit using the FEOSAD numerical hydrodynamics code. The dust component is made up of two different components: micron-sized dust and grown dust of evolving size. For the dust component, we considered the dust coagulation, fragmentation, momentum exchange with the gas, and dust self-gravity. Results. We found that the micron-sized dust particles grow rapidly in the circumstellar disk, reaching a few cm in size in the inner 100 au of the disk during less than 100 kyr after the disk formation, provided that fragmentation velocity is 30 ms -1. Due to the accretion of micron dust particles from the surrounding envelope, which serves as a micron dust reservoir, the approximately cm-sized dust particles continue to be present in the disk for more than 900 kyr after the disk formation and maintain a dust-togas ratio close to 0.01. We show that a strong correlation exists between the gas and pebble fluxes in the disk. We find that radial surface density distribution of pebbles in the disk shows power-law distribution with an index similar to that of the Minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) regardless the disk mass. We also show that the gas surface density in our models agrees well with measurements of dust in protoplanetary disks of AS 209, HD 163296, and DoAr 25 systems. Conclusions. Pebbles are formed during the very early stages of protoplanetary disk evolution. They play a crucial role in the planet formation process. Our disc simulations reveal the early onset (\textbackslash textless 10 5 yr) of an inwards-drifting flux of pebble-sized particles that makes up approximately between one hundredth and one tenth of the gas mass flux, which appears consistent with mm-observations of discs. Such a pebble flux would allow for the formation of planetesimals by streaming instability and the early growth of embryos by pebble accretion. We conclude that unlike the more common studies of isolated steady-state protoplanetary disks, more sophisticated global numerical simulations of circumstellar disk formation and evolution, including the pebble formation from the micron dust particles, are needed for performing realistic planet formation studies.},

  abstract = {Context.               The explosion of observational data on exoplanets gives many constraints on theoretical models of planet formation and evolution. Observational data probe very large areas of the parameter space and many different planet properties.                                         Aims.               Comparing theoretical models with observations allows one to take a key step forward towards understanding planetary systems. It however requires a model able to (i) predict all the necessary observable quantities (not only masses and orbits, but also radii, luminosities, magnitudes, or evaporation rates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary masses (from Mars mass to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits).                                         Methods.               We have developed a combined global end-to-end planetary formation and evolution model, the Generation III Bern model, based on the core accretion paradigm. This model solves as directly as possible the underlying differential equations for the structure and evolution of the gas disc, the dynamical state of the planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets yielding their planetesimal and gas accretion rates, disc-driven orbital migration, and the gravitational interaction of concurrently forming planets via a full               N               -body calculation. Importantly, the model also follows the long-term evolution of the planets on gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling and contraction, atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides.                                         Results.               To test the model, we compared it with classical scenarios of Solar System formation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain a giant impact phase of protoplanet-protoplanet collisions provided enough embryos (\textasciitilde 100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For the giant planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core shortly before the dispersal of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration that would bring them to the inner edge of the disc. Regarding the emergence of entire planetary systems, many aspects can be understood with the comparison of the timescales of growth and migration, the capture into resonances, and the consequences of large-scale dynamical instabilities caused by the gravitational interactions of protoplanets, including the situation when a second core starts runaway gas accretion.                                         Conclusions.               The Generation III Bern model provides one of the most comprehensive global end-to-end models of planetary system formation and evolution developed so far, linking a multitude of crucial physical processes self-consistently. The model can form planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that systems with only terrestrial planets are often well-ordered (in period, mass, and radius), while giant-planet bearing systems show no such similarity. In a series of papers, the model will be used to perform extensive planetary population syntheses, putting the current theoretical understanding of planet formation and evolution to the observational test.},

  abstract = {Context.               Planetary formation and evolution is a combination of multiple interlinked processes. Constraining the mechanisms observationally requires statistical comparison to a large diversity of planetary systems.                                         Aims.               We want to understand global observable consequences of different physical processes (accretion, migration, and interactions) and initial properties (like disc masses and metallicities) on the demographics of the planetary population. We also want to study the convergence of our scheme with respect to one initial condition, the initial number of planetary embryo in each disc.                                         Methods.               We selected distributions of initial conditions that are representative of known protoplanetary discs. Then, we used the Generation III Bern model to perform planetary population synthesis. We synthesise five populations with each a different initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last is our nominal population consisting of 1000 stars (systems) that was used for an extensive statistical analysis of planetary systems around 1               M               {$\odot$}               stars.                                         Results.               The properties of giant planets do not change much as long as there are at least ten embryos in each system. The study of giants can thus be done with simulations requiring less computational resources. For inner terrestrial planets, only the 100-embryos population is able to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each planetary system contains, on average, eight planets more massive than 1               M               {$\oplus$}               . The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital distances is 18\%, but only 1.6\% are at {$>$}10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such planets. The planetary mass function varies as               M               -2               between 5 and 50               M               {$\oplus$}               . Both at lower and higher masses, it follows approximately               M               -1               . The frequency of terrestrial and super-Earth planets peaks at a stellar [Fe/H] of -0.2 and 0.0, respectively, being limited at lower [Fe/H] by a lack of building blocks, and by (for them) detrimental growth of more massive dynamically active planets at higher [Fe/H]. The frequency of more massive planets (Neptunian, giants) increases monotonically with [Fe/H]. The fast migration of planets in the 5\textendash 50               M               {$\oplus$}               range is reduced by the presence of multiple lower-mass inner planets in the multi-embryos populations. To assess the impact of parameters and model assumptions, we also study two non-nominal populations: insitu formation without gas-driven migration, and a different initial planetesimal surface density.                                         Conclusions.               We present one of the most comprehensive simulations of (exo)planetary system formation and evolution to date. For observations, the syntheses provides a large data set to search for comparison synthetic planetary systems that show how these systems have come into existence. The systems, including their full formation and evolution tracks are available online. For theory, they provide the framework to observationally test the global statistical consequences of theoretical models for specific physical processes. This is an important ingredient towards the development of a standard model of planetary formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {We address the question of whether protoplanetary discs around low-mass stars (e.g. M-dwarfs) may be longer lived than their solar-type counterparts. This question is particularly relevant in assessing the planet-making potential of these lower mass discs. Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young stars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial distribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of disc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference between the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest-neighbour distance (normalized to the number of sources), where the older population should appear more spread out. To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial distribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low-mass star-forming regions. We find no evidence for significant age differences between the disc-bearing low-mass (later than M2) and 'solar-type' (earlier than M2) stars in these regions. We model our results by constructing and analysing synthetic fractal distributions that we evolve for typical values of the velocity dispersions. A comparison of results obtained using simple models to the results from our MST analysis suggests that the lifetime of discs around M-stars is similar to that of discs around solar-type stars. Furthermore, a model-independent spatial analysis of the observations robustly shows that any age differences between the two samples must be smaller than the average age difference between disc-bearing classical T Tauri stars and discless weak-lined T Tauri stars.},

We show that the final exoplanet distributions are strongly dependant on the choice of the photoevaporation model. In particular, we find that XEUV is more efficient than pure EUV radiation at parking planets at approximately 1-2 au distance from their central star, hence roughly reproducing the observed peak in the exoplanets semimajor axis distributions. We note however that a more quantitative comparison with the observations is hindered by the oversimplified treatment of planetary accretion, which severely affectsmigration rates. For this reason, caution should be used when using these models to constrain details of disc clearing and/or migration from the observations. Nevertheless our results indicate that disc dispersal by photoevaporation may be the main driver of the features in the exoplanets semimajor axis distribution observed by recent surveys.},

  abstract = {The presence of rings and gaps in protoplanetary discs are often ascribed to planet-disc interactions, where dust and pebbles are trapped at the edges of planetary induced gas gaps. Recent work has shown that these are likely sites for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability. Given the large amount of planetesimals that potentially form at gap edges, we address the question of their fate and ability to radially transport solids in protoplanetary discs. We perform a series of N-body simulations of planetesimal orbits, taking into account the effect of gas drag and mass loss via ablation. We consider two planetary systems: one akin to the young Solar System, and another one inspired by HL Tau. In both systems, the close proximity to the gap-opening planets results in large orbital excitations, causing the planetesimals to leave their birth locations and spread out across the disc soon after formation. Planetesimals that end up on eccentric orbits interior of 10au experience efficient ablation, and lose all mass before they reach the innermost disc region. In our nominal Solar System simulation with \$\textbackslash backslashdot\{M\}\_0=10\^\{-7\}\textbackslash backslash, M\_\{\textbackslash backslashodot\}\textbackslash backslash, \textbackslash backslashtextrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashalpha=10\^\{-2\}\$, we find that 70\% of the initial planetesimal mass has been ablated after 500kyr. The ablation rate in HL Tau is lower, and only 11\% of the initial planetesimal mass has been ablated after 1Myr. The ablated material consist of a mixture of solid grains and vaporized ices, where a large fraction of the vaporized ices re-condense to form solid ice. Assuming that the solids grow to pebbles in the disc midplane, the total integrated mass that reaches 1au is \$15\textbackslash backslash, M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ in the nominal Solar System simulation and \$25\textbackslash backslash, M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ in the nominal HL Tau simulation. Our results demonstrate that scattered planetesimals can carry a significant flux of solids past planetary-induced gaps in protoplanetary discs.},

This strategy has been shown to give better results, as fixing the coefficients to theoretical values can give rise to important systematic errors which directly impact the physical properties of the system derived from such light curves such as the planetary radius. However, studies of the effect of limb-darkening assumptions on the retrieved parameters have mostly focused on the widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out other proposed laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model intensity profiles. In this work, we show that laws such as the logarithmic, square-root and three-parameter law do a better job that the quadratic and linear laws when deriving parameters from transit light curves, both in terms of bias and precision, for a wide range of situations. We therefore recommend to study which law to use on a case-by-case basis. We provide code to guide the decision of when to use each of these laws and select the optimal one in a mean-square error sense, which we note has a dependence on both stellar and transit parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that the so-called exponential law is non-physical as it typically produces negative intensities close to the limb and should therefore not be used.},

In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines, for example, these enter as prior distributions. These can either represent our current knowledge of the distribution of such parameters (e.g., based on their observed values) or physically plausible parameters ranges to be sampled. Among the parameters that are constrained by transiting exoplanet lightcurves, there are two which are of much physical significance: the impact parameter of the orbit, \$b = (a/R\_*)\textbackslash backslashcos i \$, and the planet-to-star radius ratio, \$p = R\_p/R\_s\$ (which defines the transit depth, \$\textbackslash backslashdelta = p\^2\$). These two are natural parameters to extract and constrain as they usually have well defined limits. A common set of "uninformative" priors used for those two parameters are uniform priors. However, this poses a sampling problem especially important for grazing orbits: given that we sample a value \$p\_i\$ from the prior on \$p\$, the only physically plausible values for \$b\$ to be sampled given \$p\_i\$ are those that satisfy \$b \textbackslash textless 1 + p\_i\$. If we simply reject the sample if the sampled value of b is greater than \$1 + p\_i\$, then we will reject points from a significant portion of the prior area depending on its size. It is desirable, thus, to have an algorithm that efficiently samples values from the physically plausible zone in the \$(b,p)\$ plane. Here we present such an algorithm.},

In addition, juliet allows us to fit transiting and non-transiting multiplanetary systems, and to fit GPs which might share hyperparameters between the photometry and radial velocities simultaneously (e.g. stellar rotation periods), which might be useful for disentangling stellar activity in radial-velocity measurements. Nested Sampling, Importance Nested Sampling, and Dynamic Nested Sampling is performed with publicly available codes which in turn give juliet multithreading options, allowing it to scale the computing time of complicated multidimensional problems. We make juliet publicly available via GitHub.},

Using FEROS, HARPS, and CORALIE radial velocities, we measure a precise mass of 8.8 {$\pm$}0.6M{$\odot$} for this 1.74{$\pm$}0.05R{$\odot$} exoplanet, which provides enough information to constrain its bulk composition - similar to Earth's but enriched in iron. The radius, mass, and stellar irradiation of HD 213885b are, given our data, very similar to 55 Cancri e, making this exoplanet a good target to perform comparative exoplanetology of short period, highly irradiated super-Earths. Our precise radial velocities reveal an additional 4.78-d signal which we interpret as arising from a second, non-transiting planet in the system, HD 213885c, whose minimum mass of 19.9 {$\pm$} 1.4 M{$\odot$} makes it consistent with being a Neptune-mass exoplanet. The HD 213885 system is very interesting from the perspective of future atmospheric characterization, being the second brightest star to host an USP transiting super-Earth (with the brightest star being, in fact, 55 Cancri). Prospects for characterization with present and future observatories are discussed.},

  abstract = {Some systems of close-in `super-Earths' contain five or more planets on non-resonant but compact and nearly coplanar orbits. The Kepler-11 system is an iconic representative of this class of system. It is challenging to explain their origins given that planet\textendash disc interactions are thought to be essential to maintain such a high degree of coplanarity, yet these same interactions invariably cause planets to migrate into chains of mean motion resonances. Here, we mine a large data set of dynamical simulations of super-Earth formation by migration. These simulations match the observed period ratio distribution as long as the vast majority of planet pairs in resonance become dynamically unstable. When instabilities take place resonances are broken during a late phase of giant impacts, and typical surviving systems have planet pairs with significant mutual orbital inclinations. However, a subset of our unstable simulations matches the Kepler-11 system in terms of coplanarity, compactness, planet-multiplicity, and non-resonant state. This subset has dynamical instability phases typically much shorter than ordinary systems. Unstable systems may keep a high degree of coplanarity post-instability if planets collide at very low orbital inclinations ({$\lessequivlnt$}1{$\bigcirc$}) or if collisions promote efficient damping of orbital inclinations. If planetary scattering during the instability takes place at low orbital inclinations (i {$\lessequivlnt$} 1{$\bigcirc$}), orbital inclinations are barely increased by encounters before planets collide. When planetary scattering pumps orbital inclinations to higher values ({$\greaterequivlnt$}1{$\bigcirc$}) planets tend to collide at higher mutual orbital inclinations, but depending on the geometry of collisions mergers' orbital inclinations may be efficiently damped. Each of these formation pathways can produce analogues to the Kepler-11 system.},

We are able to constrain the eccentricities of 51 systems with a single transiting planet, which supplement our previous measurements of 66 planets in multi-planet systems. Through a Bayesian hierarchical analysis, we find evidence that systems with only one detected transiting planet have a different eccentricity distribution than systems with multiple detected transiting planets. The eccentricity distribution of the single-transiting systems is well described by the positive half of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a dispersion \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\_e = 0.32 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.06\$, while the multiple-transit systems are consistent with \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\_e = 0.083\^\{+0.015\}\_\{-0.020\}\$. A mixture model suggests a fraction of \$0.76\^\{+0.21\}\_\{-0.12\}\$ of single-transiting systems have a moderate eccentricity, represented by a Rayleigh distribution that peaks at \$0.26\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.06\}\$. This finding may reflect differences in the formation pathways of systems with different numbers of transiting planets. We investigate the possibility that eccentricities are "self-excited" in closely packed planetary systems, as well as the influence of long-period giant companion planets. We find that both mechanisms can qualitatively explain the observations. We do not find any evidence for a correlation between eccentricity and stellar metallicity, as has been seen for giant planets. Neither do we find any evidence that orbital eccentricity is linked to the detection of a companion star. Along with this paper we make available all of the parameters and uncertainties in the eccentricity distributions, as well as the properties of individual systems, for use in future studies.},

We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1 to 10 days, with a median of {$\sim$}2 d, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 d to 10\^5 d), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 d, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40 deg and 140 deg. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star.},

  abstract = {Context. ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks confirm earlier indications that there is a clear difference between the dust and gas radial extents. The origin of this difference is still debated, with both radial drift of the dust and optical depth effects suggested in the literature. Aims. In thermo-chemical models, the dust properties are usually prescribed by simple parametrisations. In this work, the feedback of more realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular emissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. Methods. The radial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models that include growth, fragmentation, and radial drift for a given static gas density structure. The vertical settling of dust particles is computed in steady-state. A new version of the code DALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence the disk thermal structure, molecular abundances, and excitation. Synthetic images of both continuum thermal emission and low J CO isotopologues lines are produced. Results. The difference of dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth of CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift. The effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the continuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by 12CO emission can easily differ by a factor of two between the models for a turbulent ff ranging between 10-4 and 10-2, with the ratio of the CO and mm radius Rout CO=Rout mm increasing with turbulence. Grain growth and settling concur in thermally decoupling the gas and dust components, due to the low collision rate with large grains. As a result, the gas can be much colder than the dust at intermediate heights, reducing the CO excitation and emission, especially for low turbulence values. Also, due to disk mid-plane shadowing, a second CO thermal desorption (rather than photodesorption) front can occur in the warmer outer mid-plane disk. The models are compared to ALMA observations of HD 163296 as a test case. In order to reproduce the observed CO snowline of the system, a binding energy for CO typical of ice mixtures, with Eb -1100 K, needs to be used rather than the lower pure CO value. Conclusions. The difference between observed gas and dust extent is largely due to optical depth effects, but radial drift and grain size evolution also affect the gas and dust emission in subtle ways. In order to properly infer fundamental quantities of the gaseous component of disks, such as disk outer radii and gas surface density profiles, simultaneous modelling of both dust and gas observations including dust evolution is needed.},

The companion Kepler-76b was identified by the BEER algorithm, which detected the BEaming (sometimes called Doppler boosting) effect together with the Ellipsoidal and Reflection/emission modulations (BEER), at an orbital period of 1.54 days, suggesting a planetary companion orbiting the 13.3 mag F star. Further investigation revealed that this star appeared in the Kepler eclipsing binary catalog with estimated primary and secondary eclipse depths of 5 \texttimes{} 10-3 and 1 \texttimes{} 10 -4, respectively. Spectroscopic radial velocity follow-up observations with Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph and SOPHIE confirmed Kepler-76b as a transiting 2.0 {$\pm$} 0.26 MJup hot Jupiter. The mass of a transiting planet can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal amplitude. The ellipsoidal-based mass estimate of Kepler-76b is consistent with the spectroscopically measured mass while the beaming-based estimate is significantly inflated. We explain this apparent discrepancy as evidence for the superrotation phenomenon, which involves eastward displacement of the hottest atmospheric spot of a tidally locked planet by an equatorial superrotating jet stream. This phenomenon was previously observed only for HD 189733b in the infrared. We show that a phase shift of 10.\textdegree 3 {$\pm$} 2.\textdegree 0 of the planet reflection/emission modulation, due to superrotation, explains the apparently inflated beaming modulation, resolving the ellipsoidal/beaming amplitude discrepancy. Kepler-76b is one of very few confirmed planets in the Kepler light curves that show BEER modulations and the first to show superrotation evidence in the Kepler band. Its discovery illustrates for the first time the ability of the BEER algorithm to detect short-period planets and brown dwarfs. \textcopyright{} 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

The fraction of accreting stars decreases from {$\sim$}60\% at 1.5-2 Myr to {$\sim$}2\% at 10 Myr. No accreting stars are found after 10 Myr at a sensitivity limit of 10-11 M\&sun; yr-1.

In most cases we find f\_acc \textbackslash textlessf\_IRAC, i.e. , mass accretion appears to cease (or drop below detectable level) earlier than the dust is dissipated in the inner disk. At 5 Myr, 95\% of the stellar population has stopped accreting material at a rate of {$\gtrapprox$}10-11 M\&sun; yr-1, while {$\sim$}20\% of the stars show near-infrared excess emission.

General formulas are given which do not depend on any assumption linking the tidal lags to the frequencies of the corresponding tidal waves (except that equal frequency harmonics are assumed to span equal lags). Emphasis is given to the cases of companions having reached one of the two possible final states: (1) the super-synchronous stationary rotation resulting from the vanishing of the average tidal torque; (2) capture into the 1:1 spin-orbit resonance (true synchronization). In these cases, the energy dissipation is controlled by the tidal harmonic with period equal to the orbital period (instead of the semi-diurnal tide) and the singularity due to the vanishing of the geometric phase lag does not exist. It is also shown that the true synchronization with non-zero eccentricity is only possible if an extra torque exists opposite to the tidal torque. The theory is developed assuming that this additional torque is produced by an equatorial permanent asymmetry in the companion. The results are model-dependent and the theory is developed only to the second degree in eccentricity and inclination (obliquity). It can easily be extended to higher orders, but formal accuracy will not be a real improvement as long as the physics of the processes leading to tidal lags is not better known. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K\textbackslash textgreater30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with -0.5+0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

  abstract = {The Second Workshop on Extreme Precision Radial Velocities defined circa 2015 the state of the art Doppler precision and identified the critical path challenges for reaching 10 cm s-1 measurement precision. The presentations and discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop recommendations for achieving this bold precision are summarized here. Beginning with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrograph, technological advances for precision radial velocity (RV) measurements have focused on building extremely stable instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to improve upon the state of the art, producing even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision RV community include distinguishing center of mass (COM) Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities (time correlated noise) and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. COM velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals. Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. However, higher precision RV measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for potentially habitable worlds, to confirm and characterize detections from transit missions, and to provide mass measurements for other space-based missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.},

These close planets origins are a mystery that motivates investigating protoplanetary disks central regions. A key factor governing the conditions near the star is the silicate sublimation front, which largely determines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner rim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the sublimation front in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae stars. The models are axisymmetric, and include starlight heating, silicate grains sublimating and condensing to equilibrium at the local, time-dependent temperature and density, and accretion stresses parametrizing the results of MHD magneto-rotational turbulence models. The results compare well with radiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable. Passing the model disks into Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we show that the models satisfy observational constraints on the inner rims location. A small optically-thin halo of hot dust naturally arises between the inner rim and the star. The inner rim has a substantial radial extent, corresponding to several disk scale heights. While the fronts overall position varies with the stellar luminosity, its radial extent depends on the mass accretion rate. A pressure maximum develops near the location of thermal ionization at temperatures about 1000 K. The pressure maximum is capable of halting solid pebbles radial drift and concentrating them in a zone where temperatures are sufficiently high for annealing to form crystalline silicates.},

We investigate conditions near the front in the protostellar disk around a young intermediate-mass star, using the first global 3-D radiation non-ideal MHD simulations in this context. We treat the starlight heating; the silicate grains sublimation and deposition at the local, time-varying temperature and density; temperature-dependent Ohmic dissipation; and various initial magnetic fields. The results show magnetorotational turbulence around the sublimation front at 0.5 AU. The disk interior to 0.8 AU is turbulent, with velocities exceeding 10\% of the sound speed. Beyond 0.8 AU is the dead zone, cooler than 1000 K and with turbulence orders of magnitude weaker. A local pressure maximum just inside the dead zone concentrates solid particles, favoring their growth. Over many orbits, a vortex develops at the dead zones inner edge, increasing the disks thickness locally by around 10\%. We synthetically observe the results using Monte Carlo transfer calculations, finding the sublimation front is near-infrared bright. The models with net vertical magnetic fields develop extended, magnetically-supported atmospheres that reprocess extra starlight, raising the near-infrared flux 20\%.The vortex throws a nonaxisymmetric shadow on the outer disk. At wavelengths \textbackslash textgreater 2 micron, the flux varies several percent on monthly timescales. The variations are more regular when the vortex is present. The vortex is directly visible as an arc at ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths, given sub-AU spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Context. The increasing number of newly detected exoplanets at short orbital periods raises questions about their formation and migration histories. Planet formation and migration depend heavily on the structure and dynamics of protoplanetary disks. A particular puzzle that requires explanation arises from one of the key results of the Kepler mission, namely the increase in the planetary occurrence rate with orbital period up to 10 days for F, G, K and M stars. Aims. We investigate the conditions for planet formation and migration near the dust sublimation front in protostellar disks around young Sun-like stars. We are especially interested in determining the positions where the drift of pebbles would be stopped, and where the migration of Earth-like planets and super-Earths would be halted. Methods. For this analysis we use iterative 2D radiation hydrostatic disk models which include irradiation by the star, and dust sublimation and deposition depending on the local temperature and vapor pressure. Results. Our results show the temperature and density structure of a gas and dust disk around a young Sun-like star. We perform a parameter study by varying the magnetized turbulence onset temperature, the accretion stress, the dust mass fraction, and the mass accretion rate. Our models feature a gas-only inner disk, a silicate sublimation front and dust rim starting at around 0.08 au, an ionization transition zone with a corresponding density jump, and a pressure maximum which acts as a pebble trap at around 0.12 au. Migration torque maps show Earth- and super-Earth-mass planets halt in our model disks at orbital periods ranging from 10 to 22 days. Conclusions. Such periods are in good agreement with both the inferred location of the innermost planets in multiplanetary systems, and the break in planet occurrence rates from the Kepler sample at 10 days. In particular, models with small grains depleted produce a trap located at a 10-day orbital period, while models with a higher abundance of small grains present a trap at around a 17-day orbital period. The snow line lies at 1.6 au, near where the occurrence rate of the giant planets peaks. We conclude that the dust sublimation zone is crucial for forming close-in planets, especially when considering tightly packed super-Earth systems.},

  abstract = {In the recent years, sub/mm observations of protoplanetary disks have discovered an incredible diversity of substructures in the dust emission. An important result was the finding that dust grains of mm size are embedded in very thin dusty disks. This implies that the dust mass fraction in the midplane becomes comparable to the gas, increasing the importance of the interaction between the two components there. We address this problem by means of numerical 2.5D simulations in order to study the gas and dust interaction in fully global stratified disks. To this purpose, we employ the recently developed dust grain module in the PLUTO code. Our model focuses on a typical T Tauri disk model, simulating a short patch of the disk at 10 au which includes grains of constant Stokes number of \$St=0.01\$ and \$St=0.1\$, corresponding to grains with sizes of 0.9 cm and 0.9 mm, respectively, for the given disk model. By injecting a constant pebble flux at the outer domain, the system reaches a quasi steady state of turbulence and dust concentrations driven by the streaming instability. For our given setup and using resolutions up to 2500 cells per scale height we resolve the streaming instability, leading to local dust clumping and concentrations. Our results show dust density values of around 10-100 times the gas density with a steady state pebble flux between \$3.5 \textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^\{-4\}\$ and \$2.5 \textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^\{-3\} M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Earth\}/\textbackslash backslashmathit\{year\}\$ for the models with \$\textbackslash backslashmathit\{St\}=0.01\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashmathit\{St\}=0.1\$. The grain size and pebble flux for model \$\textbackslash backslashmathit\{St\}=0.01\$ compares well with dust evolution models of the first million years of disk evolution. For those grains the scatter opacity dominates the extinction coefficient at mm wavelengths. These types of global dust and gas simulations are a promising tool for studies of the gas and dust evolution at pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks.},

The realization that many giant planets have large eccentricities raises a fundamental question: ``Do terrestrial-size planets of other stars typically have significantly eccentric orbits or nearly circular orbits like the Earth?'' Here we demonstrate that photometric observations of transiting planets could be used to characterize the orbital eccentricities for individual transiting planets, as well as the eccentricity distribution for various populations of transiting planets (e.g., those with a certain range of orbital periods or physical sizes). Such characterizations can provide valuable constraints on theories for the excitation of eccentricities and tidal dissipation. We outline the future prospects of the technique given the exciting prospects for future transit searches, such as those to be carried out by the COROT and Kepler missions.},

Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this purpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small datasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process modeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators \textendash{} providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice \textendash{} but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

  abstract = {Context. According to the sequential accretion model (or core-nucleated accretion model), giant planet formation is based first on the formation of a solid core which, when massive enough, can gravitationally bind gas from the nebula to form the envelope. The most critical part of the model is the formation time of the core: to trigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses before the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. Aims. We calculate planetary formation models including a detailed description of the dynamics of the planetesimal disc, taking into account both gas drag and excitation of forming planets. Methods. We computed the formation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the solid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals, exciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. Here we introduce a more realistic treatment for the evolution of planetesimals' relative velocities, which directly impact on the formation timescale. For this, we computed the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by forming planets, and gas-solid interactions. Results. We find that the formation of giant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their random velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula. Moreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also larger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of disc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their survival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime, rapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate-mass planets that have not yet started their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of these planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have masses either below 10 M or above several Jupiter masses. Conclusions. To form giant planets before the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals (0.1 km) have to be the major contributors of the solid accretion process. However, the combination of oligarchic growth and fast inward migration leads to the absence of intermediate-mass planets. Other processes must therefore be at work to explain the population of extrasolar planets that are presently known. \textcopyright{} ESO 2013.},

Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02 to 10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02 to 10 AU) through a non-gray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90\% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If "hot Neptunes" have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of 0.30-0.45 times Jupiter's radius are expected. Water planets are {$\sim$}40-50\% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii.

This includes the gas giants, such as Jupiter and Saturn, that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, as well as the "ice giants," such as Uranus and Neptune, which are primarily composed of elements heavier than H/He. The effect of different hydrogen equations of state (including new first-principles computations) on Jupiter's core mass and heavy element distribution is detailed. This variety of the hydrogen equations of state translate into an uncertainty in Jupiter's core mass of 18M {$\odot$} . For Uranus and Neptune we find deep envelope metallicities up to 0.95, perhaps indicating the existence of an eroded core, as also supported by their low luminosity. We discuss the results of simple cooling models of our solar system's planets, and show that more complex thermal evolution models may be necessary to understand their cooling history. We review how measurements of the masses and radii of the nearly 50 transiting extrasolar giant planets are changing our understanding of giant planets. In particular a fraction of these planets appear to be larger than can be accommodated by standard models of planetary contraction. We review the proposed explanations for the radii of these planets. We also discuss very young giant planets, which are being directly imaged with ground- and space-based telescopes. \textcopyright{} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

GJ 1214b is a well-studied example whose atmospheric transmission spectrum has been observed by many investigators. Here we take a step back from GJ 1214b to investigate the role that planetary mass, composition, and temperature play in impacting the transmission spectra of these low-mass low-density (LMLD) planets. Under the assumption that these planets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we use population synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of the H/He envelope are high, with metal mass fraction Z env values commonly 0.6-0.9, or {$\sim$}100-400+ times solar. The high mean molecular weight of such atmospheres ({$\mu$} {$\approx$} 5-12) would naturally help to flatten the transmission spectrum of most LMLD planets. The high metal abundance would also provide significant condensible material for cloud formation. It is known that the H/He abundance in Uranus and Neptune decreases with depth, and we show that atmospheric evaporation of LMLD planets could expose atmospheric layers with gradually higher Z env. However, values of Z env close to solar composition can also arise, so diversity should be expected. Photochemically produced hazes, potentially due to methane photolysis, are another possibility for obscuring transmission spectra. Such hazes may not form above T eq of {$\sim$}800-1100 K, which is testable if such warm, otherwise low mean molecular weight atmospheres are stable against atmospheric evaporation. We find that available transmission data are consistent with relatively high mean molecular weight atmospheres for GJ 1214b and "warm Neptune" GJ 436b. We examine future prospects for characterizing GJ 1214b with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope. \textcopyright{} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

The temperature structure, on the other hand, affects planet migration and, as a result, the outcome of planet formation. Ai ms . We extended our previous disk structure calculations to include the effect of stellar irradiation in addition to viscous heating. We then used these new structures to compute new synthetic planet populations that we compared to those obtained without taking Met into account stellar irradiation. hods . Our disk models are standard alpha-disk models calculated in the 1+1D approximation. The effect of the irradiation by the central star is treated by imposing an appropriate outer boundary conditions on temperature. The disks evolve through viscous Resul transport and photo-evaporation on timescales that match observations. t s . When compared to the nominal non-irradiated case, the irradiated disk is, as expected, warmer beyond a few AUs. This translates into a greater scale-height, which implies, everything else being equal, a transition fromtype I to type II migration for larger core masses. Because type I migration is heavily damped in our nominal model and that type II starts at larger masses, the nominal model with an irradiated disk fails to account for the presence of the numerous hot Jupiters. In other words, the effect of accounting Concl for irradiation is strong in conjunction with a heavily damped type I migration rate. u si ons . We find that reducing the slowing down of the type I migration rate to a factor ten below the linear value (instead of a factor 103 as in the nominal model) is enough to retrieve a giant planet population consistent with observations. The same effect is observed if we change the transition from type I to type II by varying the nominal criterion without considering irradiation},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that high levels of X-ray and UV activity on young M dwarfs may drive rapid atmospheric escape on temperate, terrestrial planets orbiting within the habitable zone. However, secondary atmospheres on planets orbiting older, less active M dwarfs may be stable and present more promising candidates for biomarker searches. In order to evaluate the potential habitability of Earth-like planets around old, inactive M dwarfs, we present new Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of Barnard's Star (GJ 699), a 10 Gyr old M3.5 dwarf, acquired as part of the Mega-MUSCLES program. Despite the old age and long rotation period of Barnard's star, we observe two FUV ({$\delta$}130 {$\approx$} 5000s; E130 {$\approx$} 1029.5 erg each) and one X-ray (EX {$\approx$} 1029.2 erg) flares, and estimate a high-energy flare duty cycle (defined here as the fraction of the time the star is in a flare state) of {$\sim$} 25\%. A 5 \AA{} \textendash{} 10 \textmu m spectral energy distribution of GJ 699 is created and used to evaluate the atmospheric stability of a hypothetical, unmagnetized terrestrial planet in the habitable zone (rHZ {$\sim$} 0.1 AU). Both thermal and non-thermal escape modeling indicate (1) the quiescent stellar XUV flux does not lead to strong atmospheric escape: atmospheric heating rates are comparable to periods of high solar activity on modern Earth, and (2) the flare environment could drive the atmosphere into a hydrodynamic loss regime at the observed flare duty cycle: sustained exposure to the flare environment of GJ 699 results in the loss of {$\approx$} 87 Earth atmospheres Gyr-1 through thermal processes and {$\approx$} 3 Earth atmospheres Gyr-1 through ion loss processes, respectively. These results suggest that if rocky planet atmospheres can survive the initial {$\sim$} 5 Gyr of high stellar activity, or if a second generation atmosphere can be formed or acquired, the flare duty cycle may be the controlling stellar parameter for the stability of Earth-like atmospheres around old M stars.

In this scenario, the planets scatter each other and collide, with corresponding mass growth as they merge. We numerically integrate an ensemble of systems with varying total planet mass, allowing for collisional growth, to show that (1) the high-eccentricity giants observed today may have formed preferentially in systems of higher initial total planet mass, and (2) the upper bound on the observed giant planet eccentricity distribution is consistent with planet-planet scattering.

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolar planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform numerical simulations to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives detectable by the Mission, and quantify the fraction of them that would pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest detected during the first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler is 9.4 \%, peaking for giant planets (6-22 Earth radii) at 17.7 \%, reaching a low of 6.7 \% for small Neptunes (2-4 Earth radii), and increasing again for Earth-size planets (0.8-1.25 Earth radii) to 12.3 \%. Most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5 +/- 3.6 \% of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25 Earth radii with orbital periods up to 85 days. There is no significant dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with spectral type. In the process, we derive also a prescription for the signal recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.},

  abstract = {We used high-precision radial velocity measurements of FGKM stars to determine the occurrence of giant planets as a function of orbital separation spanning 0.03\textendash 30 au. Giant planets are more prevalent at orbital distances of 1\textendash 10 au compared to orbits interior or exterior of this range. The increase in planet occurrence at {$\sim$}1 au by a factor of {$\sim$}4 is highly statistically significant. A fall-off in giant planet occurrence at larger orbital distances is favored over models with flat or increasing occurrence. We measure giant planets per 100 stars with semimajor axes of 2\textendash 8 au and giant planets per 100 stars in the range 8\textendash 32 au, a decrease in occurrence with increasing orbital separation that is significant at the {$\sim$}2{$\sigma$} level. We find that the occurrence rate of sub-Jovian planets (0.1\textendash 1 Jupiter masses) is also enhanced for 1\textendash 10 au orbits. This suggests that lower-mass planets may share the formation or migration mechanisms that drive the increased prevalence near the water\textendash ice line for their Jovian counterparts. Our measurements of cold gas giant occurrence are consistent with the latest results from direct imaging surveys and gravitational lensing surveys despite different stellar samples. We corroborate previous findings that giant planet occurrence increases with stellar mass and metallicity.},

  abstract = {The majority of gas giants (planets of masses \$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim10\^2 M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$) are found to reside at distances beyond \$\textbackslash backslashsim1\$ au from their host stars. Within 1 au, the planetary population is dominated by super-Earths of \$2-20 M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. We show that this dichotomy between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants can be naturally explained should they form in nearly inviscid disks. In laminar disks, a planet can more easily repel disk gas away from its orbit. The feedback torque from the pile-up of gas inside the planet's orbit slows down and eventually halts migration. A pressure bump outside the planet's orbit traps pebbles and solids, starving the core. Gas giants are born cold and stay cold: more massive cores are preferentially formed at larger distances, and they barely migrate under disk feedback. We demonstrate this using 2D hydrodynamical simulations of disk-planet interaction lasting up to \$10\^5\$ years: we track planet migration and pebble accretion until both come to an end by disk feedback. Whether cores undergo runaway gas accretion to become gas giants or not is determined by computing 1D gas accretion models. Our simulations show that in an inviscid minimum mass solar nebula, gas giants do not form inside \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$0.5 au, nor can they migrate there while the disk is present. We also explore the dependence on disk mass, and find that gas giants form further out in less massive disks.},

  abstract = {Statistical analyses of large surveys for transiting planets such as the Kepler mission must account for systematic errors and biases. Transit detection depends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host star properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not accurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected using criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects, combined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties of transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the Kepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius distribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15\%-20\% overestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler target catalog induces Malmquist bias toward large, more luminous stars and underestimation of the radii of about one-third of candidate planets, especially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are smaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (\textbackslash textless0.02 dex) more metal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii produce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous finding, that highly irradiated giants are more likely to have "inflated" radii, remains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit depth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of any intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation between giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an artifact. \textcopyright{} 2013.

This Neptune-size object, discovered by the NASA K2 mission, is an interloper in the "desert" of planets with similar radii on short period orbits. Our observations can be used to understand its origin and evolution by constraining the orbital eccentricity by transit fitting, measuring the spin-orbit obliquity by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, and detecting any extended, escaping hydrogen-helium envelope with the 10830A line of neutral helium in the 2s3S triplet state. Transit photometry with 1-min cadence was obtained by the K2 satellite during Campaign 18 and transit spectra were obtained with the IRD spectrograph on the Subaru telescope. While the elevated activity of K2-100 prevented us from detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, the new photometry combined with revised stellar parameters allowed us to constrain the eccentricity to e \textbackslash textless 0.15/0.28 with 90\%/99\% confidence. We modeled atmospheric escape as an isothermal, spherically symmetric Parker wind, with photochemistry driven by UV radiation that we estimate by combining the observed spectrum of the active Sun with calibrations from observations of K2-100 and similar young stars in the nearby Hyades cluster. Our non-detection (\textbackslash textless5.7mA) of a transit-associated He I line limits mass loss of a solar-composition atmosphere through a T\textbackslash textless10000K wind to \textbackslash textless0.3Me/Gyr. Either K2-100b is an exceptional desert-dwelling planet, or its mass loss is occurring at a lower rate over a longer interval, consistent with a core accretion-powered scenario for escape.},

  abstract = {The outer regions of protoplanetary accretion discs are formed by material from the parent molecular cloud of the freshly forming stars. The interstellar dust in this material is a mixture of species which does not correspond to any kind of chemical equilibrium state between the solid and gaseous phases. Mass accretion carries this material into the warm inner disc zones where chemical and physical processes are activated which convert the non-equilibrium solid-gas mixture into a chemical equilibrium mixture. Part of the equilibrated material is then mixed outwards by turbulent diffusion and large-scale circulation currents. This work specifically considers the evolution of the main dust components, viz. from the interstellar mixture of amorphous Mg-Fe-silicates, into a chemical equilibrium mixture of crystalline Mg-silicates, and iron. The basic set of equations for calculating the evolution of a mixture of silicates and iron is derived. Model calculations based on stationary, one-zone {$\alpha$}-discs are combined with the advection-diffusion-reaction equations for the dust evolution to study the interstellar to equilibrium dust conversion and the radial mixing of equilibrated dust into the outer disc regions. This determines the mixture of the main dust components which form the mineral inventory of planetesimals. It is found that the results of the model calculation for the resulting mineral mixture are in rough agreement with the composition of matrix material of primitive meteorites and dust in cometary nuclei.},

Pebbles of cm to dm sizes are thought to drift radially across protoplanetary discs faster than they can grow to larger sizes, and thus to be lost to the star. To overcome this barrier, drift has to be slowed down or stopped, or growth needs to be sped up. In this paper, we investigate the role of porosity on both drift and growth. We have developed a model for porosity evolution during grain growth and applied it to numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs. We find that growth is faster for porous grains, enabling them to transition to the Stokes drag regime, decouple from the gas, and survive the radial-drift barrier. Direct formation of small planetesimals from porous dust is possible over large areas of the disc.},

By combining the detection efficiencies of the events, we find that, at 95\% confidence, less than 25\% of our primary lenses have companions with mass ratio q=0.01 and separations in the lensing zone, 0.6-1.6 Einstein ring radii. Using a model of the mass, velocity and spatial distribution of bulge lenses, we infer that the majority of our lenses are likely M dwarfs in the Galactic bulge. We conclude that less than 33\% of M-dwarfs in the Galactic bulge have Jupiter-mass companions between 1.5 and 4 AU, and less than 45\% have 3 Jupiter-mass companions between 1 and 7 AU, the first significant limits on planetary companions to M-dwarfs. We consider the effects of the finite size of the source stars and changing our detection criterion, but find that these do not alter our conclusions substantially.},

We assess the future prospects for using the RM effect to measure the alignment of planetary orbits with the spin axes of their parent stars, and to confirm exoplanetary transits. We compute the achievable accuracy for the parameters of interest, in general and for the 5 known cases of transiting exoplanets with bright host stars. We determine the requirements for detecting the effects of differential rotation. For transiting planets with small masses or long periods (as will be detected by forthcoming satellite missions), the velocity anomaly produced by the RM effect can be much larger than the orbital velocity of the star. For a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star found by the Kepler mission, it will be difficult to use the RM effect to confirm transits with current instruments, but it still may be easier than measuring the spectroscopic orbit.},

For the first time in human history, technologies have matured sufficiently to enable an affordable space-based telescope mission capable of discovering and characterizing Earthlike planets orbiting nearby bright sunlike stars in order to search for signs of habitability and biosignatures. Such a mission can also be equipped with instrumentation that will enable broad and exciting general astrophysics and planetary science not possible from current or planned facilities. HabEx is a space telescope with unique imaging and multi-object spectroscopic capabilities at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to near-IR. These capabilities allow for a broad suite of compelling science that cuts across the entire NASA astrophysics portfolio. HabEx has three primary science goals: (1) Seek out nearby worlds and explore their habitability; (2) Map out nearby planetary systems and understand the diversity of the worlds they contain; (3) Enable new explorations of astrophysical systems from our own solar system to external galaxies by extending our reach in the UV through near-IR. This Great Observatory science will be selected through a competed GO program, and will account for about 50\% of the HabEx primary mission. The preferred HabEx architecture is a 4m, monolithic, off-axis telescope that is diffraction-limited at 0.4 microns and is in an L2 orbit. HabEx employs two starlight suppression systems: a coronagraph and a starshade, each with their own dedicated instrument.},

I next review the methods of detecting exoplanets, focusing on the ability of these methods to detect wide separation planets. For the purposes of this review, I define wide separation as separations beyond the 'snow line' of the protoplanetary disk, which is at roughly \$\textbackslash backslashsim3\$ au for a sunlike star. I note that this definition is somewhat arbitrary, and the practical boundary depends on the host star mass, planet mass and radius, and detection method. I review the approximate scaling relations for the signal-to-noise ratio for the detectability of exoplanets as a function of the relevant physical parameters, including the host star properties. I provide abroad overview of what has already been learned from the transit, radial velocity, direct imaging, and microlensing methods. I outline the challenges to synthesizing the demographics using different methods and discuss some preliminary first steps in this direction.

  abstract = {Determining habitable zones in binary star systems can be a challenging task due to the combination of perturbed planetary orbits and varying stellar irradiation conditions. The concept of "dynamically informed habitable zones" allows us, nevertheless, to make predictions on where to look for habitable worlds in such complex environments. Dynamically informed habitable zones have been used in the past to investigate the habitability of circumstellar planets in binary systems and Earth-like analogs in systems with giant planets. Here, we extend the concept to potentially habitable worlds on circumbinary orbits. We show that habitable zone borders can be found analytically even when another giant planet is present in the system. By applying this methodology to Kepler-16, Kepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-38, Kepler-64, Kepler-413, Kepler-453, Kepler-1647 and Kepler-1661 we demonstrate that the presence of the known giant planets in the majority of those systems does not preclude the existence of potentially habitable worlds. Among the investigated systems Kepler-35, Kepler-38 and Kepler-64 currently seem to offer the most benign environment. In contrast, Kepler-16 and Kepler-1647 are unlikely to host habitable worlds.},

  abstract = {Context. If planetesimal formation is an efficient process, as suggested by several models involving gravitational collapse of pebble clouds, then, not before long, a significant part of the primordial dust mass should be absorbed in many km-sized objects. A good understanding of the total amount of solids in the disk around a young star is crucial for planet formation theory. However, as the mass of particles above the mm size cannot be assessed observationally, one must ask how much mass is hidden in bigger objects. Aims. We performed 0-d local simulations to study how the planetesimal to dust and pebble ratio evolves in time and to develop an understanding of the potentially existing mass in planetesimals for a certain amount of dust and pebbles at a given disk age. Methods. We performed a parameter study based on a model considering dust growth, planetesimal formation, and collisional fragmentation of planetesimals, while neglecting radial transport processes. Results. While at early times, dust is the dominant solid particle species, there is a phase during which planetesimals make up a significant portion of the total mass starting at approximately 104-106 yr. The time of this phase and the maximal total planetesimal mass strongly depend on the distance to the star R, the initial disk mass, and the efficiency of planetesimal formation {$\epsilon$}. Planetesimal collisions are more significant in more massive disks, leading to lower relative planetesimal fractions compared to less massive disks. After approximately 106 yr, our model predicts planetesimal collisions to dominate, which resupplies small particles. Conclusions. In our model, planetesimals form fast and everywhere in the disk. For a given {$\epsilon$}, we are able to relate the dust content and mass of a given disk to its planetesimal content, providing us with some helpful basic intuition about mass distribution of solids and its dependence on underlying physical processes.},

  abstract = {The formation of planetesimals is an unsolved problem in planet formation theory. A prominent scenario for overcoming dust growth barriers in dead zones is the gravitational collapse of locally overdense regions, shown to robustly produce {$\sim$}100 km sized objects. Still, the conditions under which planetesimal formation occurs remain unclear. For collapse to proceed, the self-gravity of an overdensity must overcome stellar tidal disruption on large scales and turbulent diffusion on small scales. Here, we relate the scales of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which both regulate particle densities on the scales of gravitational collapse, directly to planetesimal formation. We support our analytic findings by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulations of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and planetesimal formation. We find that the vertical extent of the particle mid-plane layer and the radial width of streaming instability filaments are set by the same characteristic length scale, thus governing the strength of turbulent diffusion on the scales of planetesimal formation. We present and successfully test a collapse criterion: 0.1Q{$\beta\epsilon-$}1Z-1 . 1 and show that even for Solar metallicities, planetesimals can form in dead zones of sufficiently massive disks. For a given gas Toomre-parameter Q, pressure gradient {$\beta$}, metallicity Z and local particle enhancement {$\epsilon$}, the collapse criterion also provides a range of unstable scales, instituting a promising path for studying initial planetesimal mass distributions. Streaming instability is not required for planetesimal collapse, but by increasing {$\epsilon$}, can evolve a system to instability.},

Correlations between host-star metallicities, planet radii, and planetary architecture (orbital periods - warm or hot - and multiplicity - single or multiple), were investigated using non-parametric statistical tests. In addition to confirming previous results from the literature, e.g., that overall host star metallicity distributions differ between hot and warm planetary systems of all types, we report on a new finding that when comparing the median metallicities of hot versus warm systems, the difference for multiple Super-Earths is considerably larger when compared to that difference in single Super-Earths. The metallicity CDFs of hot single Super-Earths versus warm single Super-Earths indicate different parent stellar populations, while for Sub-Neptunes this is not the case. The transition radius between Sub-Neptunes and Sub-Saturns was examined by comparing the APOGEE metallicity distribution for the Milky Way thin disk in the solar neighborhood with metallicity distributions of host stars segregated based upon the largest known planet in their system. These comparisons reveal increasingly different metallicity distributions as the radius of the largest planet in the systems increases, with the parent stellar metallicities becoming significantly different for R\$\_\{p\}\textbackslash textgreater\$ 2.7 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$.

These measures are based in complexity theory and capture the global, system-level trends of each architecture. Our approach considers all planets in a system simultaneously, facilitating both intra-system and inter-system analysis. We find that based on these measures, Kepler's high-multiplicity (N {$\geq$} 3) systems can be explained if most systems belong to a single intrinsic population, with a subset of high-multiplicity systems ({$\sim$} 20\%) hosting additional, undetected planets intermediate in period between the known planets. We confirm prior findings that planets within a system tend to be roughly the same size and approximately coplanar. We find that forward modeling has not yet reproduced the high degree of spacing similarity (in log-period) actually seen in the Kepler data. Although our classification scheme was developed using compact Kepler multis as a test sample, our methods can be immediately applied to any other population of exoplanetary systems. We apply this classification scheme to (1) quantify the similarity between systems, (2) resolve observational biases from physical trends, and (3) identify which systems to search for additional planets and where to look for these planets.

  abstract = {Some recently discovered short-period Earth to Neptune sized exoplanets (super Earths) have low observed mean densities which can only be explained by voluminous gaseous atmospheres. Here, we study the conditions allowing the accretion and retention of such atmospheres. We self-consistently couple the nebular gas accretion onto rocky cores and the subsequent evolution of gas envelopes following the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we address mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We find that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percents in mass) following the disk's dispersal (even without photo-evaporation), and their atmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the underlying rocky core. At this stage, atmospheres containing less particles than the core (equivalently, lighter than a few \% of the planet's mass) can be blown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool and contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale to the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the mass-temperature plane in which low-density super Earths can be found: planets have to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres, while not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion and become gas giants (Jupiters). We compare our results to the observed super-Earth population and find that low-density planets are indeed concentrated in the theoretically allowed region. Our analytical and intuitive model can be used to investigate possible super-Earth formation scenarios.},

This valley may suggest a bimodal population of rocky planets that are either engulfed by massive gas envelopes that significantly enlarge their radius, or do not have detectable atmospheres at all. One explanation of such a bimodal distribution is atmospheric erosion by high-energy stellar photons. We investigate an alternative mechanism: the luminosity of the cooling rocky core, which can completely erode light envelopes while preserving heavy ones, produces a deficit of intermediate sized planets. We evolve planetary populations that are derived from observations using a simple analytical prescription, accounting selfconsistently for envelope accretion, cooling and mass-loss, and demonstrate that core-powered mass-loss naturally reproduces the observed radius distribution, regardless of the high-energy incident flux. Observations of planets around different stellar types may distinguish between photoevaporation, which is powered by the high-energy tail of the stellar radiation, and corepowered mass-loss, which depends on the bolometric flux through the planet's equilibrium temperature that sets both its cooling and mass-loss rates.},

The presence or absence of specific changes is used to bound the values of Q (the specific dissipation function) appropriate for the planets and satellites. It is shown that the values of Q separate sharply into two groups. Values in the range from 10 to 500 are found for the terrestrial planets and satellites of the major planets. On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 \texttimes{} 104. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

We review the basic physical processes by which solid bodies accrete each other and alter each others' random velocities, and we provide order-of-magnitude derivations for the rates of these processes. We discuss and exercise the two-groups approximation, a simple yet powerful technique for solving the evolution equations for protoplanet growth. We describe orderly, runaway, neutral, and oligarchic growth. We also delineate the conditions under which each occurs. We refute a popular misconception by showing that the outer planets formed quickly by accreting small bodies. Then we address the final stages of planet formation. Oligarchy ends when the surface density of the oligarchs becomes comparable to that of the small bodies. Dynamical friction is no longer able to balance viscous stirring and the oligarchs' random velocities increase. In the inner-planet system, oligarchs collide and coalesce. In the outer-planet system, some of the oligarchs are ejected. In both the inner- and outer-planet systems, this stage ends once the number of big bodies has been reduced to the point that their mutual interactions no longer produce large-scale chaos. Subsequently, dynamical friction by the residual small bodies circularizes and flattens their orbits. The final stage of planet formation involves the clean up of the residual small bodies. Clean up has been poorly explored.},

  abstract = {We study how the interaction between the streaming instability and intrinsic gas-phase turbulence affects planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse. Turbulence impedes the formation of dense particle clumps by acting as an effective turbulent diffusivity, but it can also promote planetesimal formation by concentrating solids, for example in zonal flows. We quantify the effect of turbulent diffusivity using numerical simulations of the streaming instability in small local domains, forced with velocity perturbations that establish approximately Kolmogorov-like fluid turbulence. We find that planetesimal formation is strongly suppressed by turbulence once velocity fluctuations exceed a threshold value of \$\textbackslash backslashdelta v\^2 \textbackslash backslashsimeq 10\^\{-3.5\} - 10\^\{-3\} c\_s\^2\$. Turbulence whose strength is just below the threshold reduces the rate of solid material being converted into bound clumps. The main effect of turbulence is to thicken the mid-plane solid layer. Our results are thus consistent with planetesimal formation requiring a mid-plane solid-to-gas ratio \$\textbackslash backslashepsilon \textbackslash backslashgtrsim 0.5\$. We describe a method for tracking bound clumps in our simulations, and use this method to construct a mass function of planetesimals that is measured for each clump shortly after its collapse. Adopting this definition of the initial mass, instead of measuring masses at a fixed time, reduces planetesimal masses by a factor of three. For models in which planetesimals form, we show that the initial mass function is well-described by a broken power law, whose parameters are robust to the inclusion and strength of imposed turbulence. Turbulence in protoplanetary disks is likely to substantially exceed the threshold for planetesimal formation at radii where temperatures \$T \textbackslash backslashgtrsim 10\^3 \textbackslash backslash \{\textbackslash backslashrm K\}\$ lead to thermal ionization. Fully in situ planetesimal and planet formation may therefore not be viable for the closest-in exoplanets.},

We focus on the effects of FUV and X-ray photons since EUV photoevaporation has been treated previously, and consider central star masses in the range 0.3-7 M. Contrary to the EUV photoevaporation scenario, which creates a gap at about rg 7(M */M{$\odot$}) AU and then erodes the outer disk from inside out, we find that FUV photoevaporation predominantly removes less bound gas from the outer disk. Heating by FUV photons can cause significant erosion of the outer disk where most of the mass is typically located. X-rays indirectly increase the mass-loss rates (by a factor of 2) by ionizing the gas, thereby reducing the positive charge on grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and enhancing FUV-induced grain photoelectric heating. FUV and X-ray photons may create a gap in the disk at 10 AU under favorable circumstances. Photoevaporation timescales for M * 1 M {$\odot$} stars are estimated to be 10 6 years, after the onset of disk irradiation by FUV and X-rays. Disk lifetimes do not vary much for stellar masses in the range 0.3-3 M {$\odot$}. More massive stars ({$\greaterequivlnt$}7 M{$\odot$}) lose their disks rapidly (in 105 years) due to their high EUV and FUV fields. Disk lifetimes are shorter for shallow surface density distributions and when the dust opacity in the disk is reduced by processes such as grain growth or settling. The latter suggests that the photoevaporation process may accelerate as the dust disk evolves. \textcopyright{} 2009. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We present the first measurement of the planet frequency beyond the "snow line," for the planet-to-star mass-ratio interval-4.5 \textbackslash textless logq \textbackslash textless-2, corresponding to the range of ice giants to gas giants. We find d 2Np1/dlog q d log s= (0.36 {$\pm$} 0.15) dex dlog q d logs at the mean mass ratio q = 5 \texttimes{} 10-4 with no discernible deviation from a flat (\"opik's law) distribution in logprojected separation s. The determination is based on a sample of six planets detected from intensive follow-up observations of high-magnification (A \textbackslash textgreater 200) microlensing events during 2005-2008. The sampled host stars have a typical mass Mhost {$\sim$} 0.5 M{$\odot$}, and detection is sensitive to planets over a range of planet-star-projected separations (s max -1Re, s maxRE), where Re {$\sim$} 3.5 AU(Mhost/M{$\odot$}) 1/2 is the Einstein radius and smax {$\sim$} (q/10 -43)1/3. This corresponds to deprojected separations roughly three times the "snow line." We show that the observations of these events have the properties of a "controlled experiment," which is what permits measurement of absolute planet frequency. High-magnification events are rare, but the survey-plus-follow-up high-magnification channel is very efficient: half of all high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yielded planet detections. The extremely high sensitivity of high-mag events leads to a policy of monitoring them as intensively as possible, independent of whether they show evidence of planets. This is what allows us to construct an unbiased sample. The planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 8 larger than the one derived from Doppler studies at factor {$\sim$}25 smaller star-planet separations (i.e., periods 2-2000 days). However, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived from Doppler studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it is measured). This suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex in planet-star separation, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass. Finally, if all planetary systems were "analogs" of the solar system, our sample would have yielded 18.2 planets (11.4 "Jupiters," 6.4 "Saturns," 0.3 "Uranuses," 0.2 "Neptunes") including 6.1 systems with two or more planet detections. This compares to six planets including one twoplanet system in the actual sample, implying a first estimate of 1/6 for the frequency of solar-like systems.},

  abstract = {Absolute shifts of spectral-line bisectors (the third signature of granulation) are shown to follow the solar pattern, i.e., weaker lines are more blue-shifted than stronger lines, for a selection of stars on the cool side of the granulation boundary in the H-R diagram. These patterns scale to the solar case by multiplicative factors ranging from 0.53 to 2.10, which is a measure of the granulation velocity gradient through the stellar photosphere. The scale factors increase with effective temperature and are larger in giants than in dwarfs. A universal relation is constructed relating line depth to convective blueshift. The scale factors vary in concert with the first and second granulation signatures, macroturbulence, and asymmetry of spectral lines. Matching the stellar to the solar third signature also results in a determination of the apparent absolute radial velocity of the star with errors ranging from 80 to 300 m s-1, but potentially considerably smaller. The star {$\gamma$} Cyg, which shows reversed-C-shaped bisectors and lies on the hot side of the granulation boundary, also shows weak lines more blue-shifted than stronger lines. \textcopyright{} 2009.

  abstract = {Context. The TRAPPIST-1 system hosts seven Earth-sized, temperate exoplanets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star. As such, it represents a remarkable setting to study the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets that formed in the same protoplanetary disk. While the sizes of the TRAPPIST-1 planets are all known to better than 5\% precision, their densities have significant uncertainties (between 28\% and 95\%) because of poor constraints on the planet's masses. Aims.The goal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary masses and densities using transit-timing variations (TTV). The complexity of the TTV inversion problem is known to be particularly acute in multi-planetary systems (convergence issues, degeneracies and size of the parameter space), especially for resonant chain systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Methods. To overcome these challenges, we have used a novel method that employs a genetic algorithm coupled to a full N-body integrator that we applied to a set of 284 individual transit timings. This approach enables us to efficiently explore the parameter space and to derive reliable masses and densities from TTVs for all seven planets. Results. Our new masses result in a five- to eight-fold improvement on the planetary density uncertainties, with precisions ranging from 5\% to 12\%. These updated values provide new insights into the bulk structure of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We find that TRAPPIST-1\$\textbackslash backslash\$,c and e likely have largely rocky interiors, while planets b, d, f, g, and h require envelopes of volatiles in the form of thick atmospheres, oceans, or ice, in most cases with water mass fractions less than 5\%.},

  abstract = {The formation of the first planetesimals and the final growth of planetary cores likely relies on the abundance of small pebbles. The efficiencies of both the streaming instability (SI) process, suggested to catalyze the early growth of planetesimals, and the pebble-accretion process, suggested to accelerate the growth of planetary cores, depend on the sizes of solids residing in the disk. In particular, these processes were found to be sensitive to size-distribution of solids, and efficient planetesimal formation and growth through these channels require a limited pebble size-distribution. Here we show that aeolian-erosion, a process that efficiently grinds down boulders into a mono-sized distribution of pebbles, provides a natural upper cut-off for the maximal pebble sizes. We find the dependence of the critical solids size cut-off on the radial separation, disk age, turbulence strength, and the grain-size composition of the boulders in the disk. This size cut-off shapes the size distribution of small pebbles and thereby helps catalyze the early onset of SI formation of planetesimals, and the later core accretion growth through pebble accretion.},

  abstract = {The insolation a planet receives from its parent star is the main engine of the climate and depends on the planet's orbital configuration. Planets with non-zero obliquity and eccentricity will experience seasonal insolation variations. As a result, the climate will have a seasonal cycle, with its strength depending on the orbital configuration, and atmospheric characteristics. In this study, using an idealized general circulation model, we examine the climate response to changes in eccentricity for both zero and non-zero obliquity planets. In the zero obliquity case, a comparison between the seasonal response to changes in eccentricity and perpetual changes in the solar constant shows that the seasonal response strongly depends on the orbital period and radiative timescale. More specifically, using a simple energy balance model, we show the importance of the latitudinal structure of the radiative timescale in the climate response. We also show that the response strongly depends on the atmospheric moisture content. The combination of an eccentric orbit with non-zero obliquity is complex, as the insolation also depends on the perihelion position. Although the detailed response of the climate to variations in eccentricity, obliquity, and perihelion is involved, the circulation is constrained mainly by the thermal Rossby number and latitude of maximum temperature. Finally, we discuss the importance of different planetary parameters that affect the climate response to orbital configuration variations.},

  abstract = {Context. In the classical core-accretion planet-formation scenario, rapid inward migration and accretion timescales of kilometer size planetesimals may not favor the formation of massive cores of giant planets before the dissipation of protoplanetary disks. On the other hand, the existence of pressure maxima in the disk could act as migration traps and locations for solid material accumulation, favoring the formation of massive cores. Aims. We aim to study the radial drift of pebbles and planetesimals and planet migration at pressure maxima in a protoplanetary disk and their implications for the formation of massive cores as triggering a gaseous runaway accretion phase. Methods. The time evolution of a viscosity driven accretion disk is solved numerically introducing a a dead zone as a low-viscosity region in the protoplanetary disk. A population of pebbles and planetesimals evolving by radial drift and accretion by the planets is also considered. Finally, the embryos embedded in the disk grow by the simultaneous accretion of pebbles, planetesimals, and the surrounding gas. Results. Our simulations show that the pressure maxima generated at the edges of the low-viscosity region of the disk act as planet migration traps, and that the pebble and planetesimal surface densities are significantly increased due to the radial drift towards pressure maxima locations. However, our simulations also show that migration-trap locations and solid-material-accumulation locations are not exactly at the same positions. Thus, a planet's semi-major axis oscillations around zero torque locations predicted by MHD and HD simulations are needed for the planet to accrete all the available material accumulated at the pressure maxima. Conclusions. Pressure maxima generated at the edges of a low-viscosity region of a protoplanetary disk seem to be preferential locations for the formation and trap of massive cores.},

Pressure maxima are known to be dust collectors and planet migration traps. The great majority of planet formation works are based either on the pebble accretion model or on the planetesimal accretion model. However, recent studies proposed the possible formation of Jupiter by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. Aims. Here we aim to study the full process of planet formation consisting of dust evolution, planetesimal formation and planet growth at a pressure maximum in a protoplanetary disk. Methods. We compute, through numerical simulations, the gas and dust evolution in a protoplanetary disk, including dust growth, fragmentation, radial drift and particle accumulation at a pressure maximum. We also consider the formation of planetesimals by streaming instability and the formation of a moon-size embryo that grows into a giant planet by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals, all within the pressure maximum. Results. We find that pressure maxima in protoplanetary disks are efficient collectors of dust drifting inwards. The condition of planetesimal formation by streaming instability is fulfilled due to the large amount of dust accumulated at the pressure bump. Then, a massive core is quickly formed (in {$\sim$} 104 yr) by the accretion of pebbles. After the pebble isolation mass is reached, the growth of the core slowly continues by the accretion of planetesimals. The energy released by planetesimal accretion delays the onset of runaway gas accretion, allowing a gas giant to form after {$\sim$}1 Myr of disk evolution. The pressure maximum also acts as a migration trap. Conclusions. Pressure maxima in protoplanetary disks are preferential locations for dust traps, planetesimal formation by streaming instability and planet migration traps. All these conditions allow the fast formation of a giant planet by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals.},

The dust and gas distribution and its evolution with time is one of the key elements in the process. Aims. We attempt to characterize the radial distribution of dust in disks around a sample of young stars from an observational point of view, and, when possible, in a model-independent way, by using parametric laws. Methods. We used the IRAM PdBI interferometer to provide very high angular resolution (down to 0.4{${'}{'}$} in some sources) observations of the continuum at 1.3 mm and 3 mm around a sample of T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga region. The sample includes single and multiple systems, with a total of 23 individual disks. We used track-sharing observing mode to minimize the biases. We fitted these data with two kinds of models: a "truncated power law" model and a model presenting an exponential decay at the disk edge ("viscous" model). Results. Direct evidence for tidal truncation is found in the multiple systems. The temperature of the mm-emitting dust is constrained in a few systems. Unambiguous evidence for large grains is obtained by resolving out disks with very low values of the dust emissivity index {$\beta$}. In most disks that are sufficiently resolved at two different wavelengths, we find a radial dependence of {$\beta$}, which appears to increase from low values (as low as 0) at the center to about 1.7-2 at the disk edge. The same behavior could apply to all studied disks. It introduces further ambiguities in interpreting the brightness profile, because the regions with apparent {$\beta$} \^a{\^\textperthousand} 0 can also be interpreted as being optically thick when their brightness temperature is high enough. Despite the added uncertainty on the dust absorption coefficient, the characteristic size of the disk appears to increase with a higher estimated star age. Conclusions. These results provide the first direct evidence of the radial dependence of the grain size in proto-planetary disks. Constraints of the surface density distributions and their evolution remain ambiguous because of a degeneracy with the {$\beta$}(r) law. \textcopyright{} 2011 ESO.},

Our results are based on intermediate-resolution spectrophotometry from 3200 to 5200 \AA, which is used to derive the excess hot continuum emission produced by accretion onto the central star. Previous estimates of T Tauri accretion rates in the literature differ by as much as 1 order of magnitude; our measurements agree better with the lowest estimates, and we discuss the problems and systematic effects that led to the previous disagreement. In particular, we note that the stellar photospheric emission from nonaccreting T Tauri stars exhibits color anomalies compared to main-sequence stars; these anomalies make the estimated extinction depend upon the color index used. We argue that the V-R index is a reasonable compromise to match with optically derived spectral types, and that V-I and V-J are much more likely to be biased by cooler companion stars and starspots. We develop a calibration with which approximate mass accretion rates can be derived for T Tauri stars based on broadband photometry and spectral types, which should enable accretion rates to be estimated for large samples with greater ease.

  abstract = {Young stars and planetary systems form in molecular clouds. For classical T Tauri stars (CTTS, F-K type precursors) the accretion disk does not reach down to the central star, but it is truncated near the co-rotation radius. The inner edge of the disk is ionized by the stellar radiation, so that the accretion stream is funneled along the magnetic field lines. On the stellar surface an accretion shock develops, which is observed over a wide wavelength range as X-ray emission, UV excess, optical veiling and optical and IR emission lines. Some of the accretion tracers, e.g. H\$\textbackslash backslash\$alpha, can be calibrated to measure the accretion rate. This accretion process is variable on time scales of hours to years due to changing accretion rates, stellar rotation and reconfiguration of the magnetic field. Furthermore, many accreting systems also drive strong outflows which are ultimately powered by accretion. Several components could contribute to the outflows: slow, wide-angle disk winds, X-winds launched close to the inner disk rim, and thermally driven stellar winds. In any case, the outflows contain material of very different temperatures and speeds. The disk wind is cool and can have a molecular component with just a few tens of km/s, while the central component of the outflow can reach a few 100 km/s. In some cases the inner part of the outflow is collimated to a small-angle jet. These jets have an onion-like structure, where the inner components are consecutively hotter and faster. The jets can contain working surfaces, which show up as Herbig-Haro knots.

  abstract = {Recent observations revealed a bimodal radius distribution of small, short-period exoplanets with a paucity in their occurrence, a radius 'valley', around 1.5-2.0 R{$\oplus$}. In this work, we investigate the effect of a planet's own cooling luminosity on its thermal evolution and atmospheric mass loss (core-poweredmass-loss) and determine its observational consequences for the radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets. Using simple analytical descriptions and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that planetary evolution based on the corepowered mass-loss mechanism alone (i.e. without any photoevaporation) can produce the observed valley in the radius distribution. Our results match the valley's location, shape and slope in planet radius-orbital period parameter space, and the relative magnitudes of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We find that the slope of the valley is, to first order, dictated by the atmospheric mass-loss time-scale at the Bondi radius and given by d logRp/d logP {$\simeq$} 1/(3(1 - {$\beta$})) that evaluates to -0.11 for {$\beta$} {$\simeq$} 4, where Mc/M{$\oplus$} = (Rc/R{$\oplus$}){$\beta$}({$\rho$}c{${_\ast}$}/{$\rho\oplus$}){$\beta$}/3 is the mass-radius relation of the core. This choice for {$\beta$} yields good agreement with observations and attests to the significance of internal compression for massive planetary cores.We further find that the location of the valley scales as {$\rho$}-4/9 c{${_\ast}$} and that the observed planet population must have predominantly rocky cores with typical water-ice fractions of less than {$\sim$}20 per cent. Furthermore, we show that the relative magnitude of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley is sensitive to the details of the planet-mass distribution but that the location of the valley is not.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that atmospheric mass-loss powered by the cooling luminosity of a planet's core can explain the observed radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, even without photoevaporation. In this work, we investigate the dependence of this core-powered mass-loss mechanism on stellar mass (M{${_\ast}$}), metallicity (Z{${_\ast}$}), and age ({$\tau{_\ast}$}). Without making any changes to the underlying planet population, we find that the corepowered mass-loss model yields a shift in the radius valley to larger planet sizes around more massive stars with a slope given by dlog Rp/dlogM{${_\ast}$} {$\simeq$} 0.35, in agreement with observations. To first order, this slope is driven by the dependence of core-powered mass-loss on the bolometric luminosity of the host star and is given by dlog Rp/dlogM{${_\ast}$} {$\simeq$} (3{$\alpha$} - 2)/36 {$\simeq$} 0.33, where (L{${_\ast}$}/L{$\odot$}) = (M{${_\ast}$}/M{$\odot$}){$\alpha$} is the stellar mass-luminosity relation and {$\alpha$} {$\simeq$} 4.6 for the CKS data set. We therefore find, in contrast to photoevaporation models, no evidence for a linear correlation between planet and stellar mass, but cannot rule it out either. In addition, we show that the location of the radius valley is, to first order, independent of stellar age and metallicity. Since core-powered mass-loss proceeds over Gyr time-scales, the abundance of super-Earths relative to sub-Neptunes increases with age but decreases with stellar metallicity. Finally, due to the dependence of the envelope's cooling time-scale on metallicity, we find that the radii of sub-Neptunes increase with metallicity and decrease with age with slopes given by dlogRp/dlog Z{${_\ast}$} {$\simeq$} 0.1 and dlog Rp/dlog {$\tau{_\ast}$} {$\simeq$} -0.1, respectively. We conclude with a series of observational tests that can differentiate between core-powered mass-loss and photoevaporation models.},

With the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), there is a need to elucidate the balance between investments in telescope time versus scientific yield. We use the supervised machine learning method of the random forest to perform an information content analysis on a 11-parameter model of transmission spectra from the various NIRSpec modes. The three bluest medium-resolution NIRSpec modes (0.7 - 1.27 microns, 0.97 - 1.84 microns, 1.66 - 3.07 microns) are insensitive to the presence of CO. The reddest medium-resolution mode (2.87 - 5.10 microns) is sensitive to all of the molecules assumed in our model: CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, H2O, HCN and NH3. It competes effectively with the three bluest modes on the information encoded on cloud abundance and particle size. It is also competitive with the low-resolution prism mode (0.6 - 5.3 microns) on the inference of every parameter except for the temperature and ammonia abundance. We recommend astronomers to use the reddest medium-resolution NIRSpec mode for studying the atmospheric chemistry of 800-1200 K warm Neptunes; its corresponding high-resolution counterpart offers diminishing returns. We compare our findings to previous JWST information content analyses that favor the blue orders, and suggest that the reliance on chemical equilibrium could lead to biased outcomes if this assumption does not apply. A simple, pressure-independent diagnostic for identifying chemical disequilibrium is proposed based on measuring the abundances of H2O, CO and CO2.},

Convergent orbital migration and resonant capture at the time of formation would naturally explain the present-day resonant orbital configurations of these systems. Planets that experience smooth migration and eccentricity damping forces due to a proto-planetary disk should not only capture into mean motion resonances but also end up in a specific dynamical configuration within the resonance, sometimes referred to as apsidal corotation resonance (ACR). Here we develop a method for testing the hypothesis that a planet pair resides in an ACR by directly fitting radial velocity data. The ACR hypothesis strongly restricts the number of free parameters describing the radial velocity signal and we compare fits using this highly restricted model to fits using a more conventional two-planet RV model by using nested sampling simulations. We apply our method to HD 45364 and HD 33844, two systems hosting giant planet pairs in 3:2 and 5:3 resonances, respectively. We demonstrate that the observations of both systems support an ACR configuration and we use the results of our ACR model fits to constrain possible migration histories of these systems.},

V-band photometry reveals a clear stellar rotation signature of the host star with a period of 98days, well separated from the period of the RV variations and reinforcing a Keplerian origin for the observed velocity variations. The orbital period of this planet corresponds to an orbit in the habitable zone of HIP 57050, with an expected planetary temperature of 230 K. The star has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.32 0.06 dex, of order twice solar and among the highest metallicity stars in the immediate solar neighborhood. This newly discovered planet provides further support that the well-known planet-metallicity correlation for F, G, and K stars also extends down into the M-dwarf regime. The a priori geometric probability for transits of this planet is only about 1\%. However, the expected eclipse depth is 7\%, considerably larger than that yet observed for any transiting planet. Though long on the odds, such a transit is worth pursuing as it would allow for high quality studies of the atmosphere via transmission spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope.

Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high (\textbackslash textgreater=80\%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in \textbackslash textless{$\sim$}3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of {$\sim$}6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks. This should set a meaningful constraint for the planet-building timescale in stellar clusters. The implications of these results for current theories of planet formation are briefly discussed.},

This paper describes an end-to-end simulation of generating and processing such data to help us better understand the impact of uncharacterized stellar noise in the recovery of Earth-mass planets with orbital periods of the order of many months. We consider full Keplerian systems, realistic simulated stellar noise, instrument white noise, and location-specific weather patterns for our observation schedules. We use Bayesian statistics to assess various planetary models fitted to the synthetic data, and compare the successful planet recovery of the Terra Hunting Experiment schedule with a typical reference survey. We find that the Terra Hunting Experiment can detect Earth twins in the habitable zones of solar-type stars, in single and multiplanet systems, and in the presence of stellar signals, that it outperforms a typical reference survey on the accuracy of recovered parameters, and that it performs comparably to an uninterrupted space-based schedule.},

  abstract = {The giant planet occurrence rate rises with orbital period out to at least \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$300 days. Large-scale planetary migration through the disk has long been suspected to be the physical origin of this feature, as the timescale of standard Type I migration in a standard solar nebula is longer farther from the star. These calculations also find that typical Jupiter-bearing cores shuttle towards the disk inner edge on timescales orders of magnitude shorter than the gas disk lifetime. The presence of gas giants at myriad distances requires mechanisms to slow large-scale migration. We revisit the migration paradigm by deriving model occurrence rate profiles from migration of cores, mass growth by gas accretion, and planetary gap opening. We show explicitly that the former two processes occur in tandem. Radial transport of planets can slow down significantly once deep gaps are carved out by their interaction with disk gas. Disks are more easily perturbed closer to the star, so accounting for gap opening flattens the final orbital period distribution. To recover the observed rise in occurrence rate, gas giants need to be more massive farther out, which is naturally achieved if their envelopes are dust-free. The range of mass gradients we find to reconcile the observed occurrence rate of Jupiters is too abrupt to account for the mass-period distribution of low-eccentricity giant planets, challenging disk migration as the dominant origin channel of hot and warm Jupiters. Future efforts in characterizing the unbiased mass distribution will place stronger constraints on predictions from migration theory.},

We show that under the mass loss hypothesis, the sub-Saturn occurrence rate can be leveraged to infer their underlying core mass function, and by extension that of gas giants. We determine that lognormal core mass functions peaked near \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$10\textendash 20\$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ are compatible with the sub-Saturn period distribution, the distribution of observationally-inferred sub-Saturn cores, and gas accretion theories.

We find that the anomaly cannot be fully explained by the binary-lens or binary-source interpretations and its description requires the introduction of an additional lens component. The 3L1S (3 lens components and a single source) modeling yields three sets of solutions, in which one set of solutions indicates that the lens is a planetary system in a binary, while the other two sets imply that the lens is a multiplanetary system.

From the Bayesian analysis, we find that the lens is composed of two planets with masses 1.8-+13...14 MJ and 2.8-+15..71 MJ around a host with a mass 0.18-+00..1033 M and located at a distance 7.1+-11..15 kpc.

We are able to consistently describe the distribution of extrasolar planetary systems in terms of period, eccentricity, and mass (with a lower limit of a Saturn mass) with this simple model. Our model is consistent with the survival of short-period exoplanet systems, but not with the circularization period of equal mass stellar binaries, suggesting that the latter systems experience a higher level of dissipation than exoplanet host stars. Our model is also not consistent with the explanation of inflated planetary radii as resulting from tidal dissipation. The paucity of short-period planets around evolved A stars is explained as the result of enhanced tidal inspiral resulting from the increase in stellar radius with evolution. \textcopyright{} 2010.

  abstract = {We present a new empirical calibration of equilibrium tidal theory for extrasolar planet systems, extending a prior study by incorporating detailed physical models for the internal structure of planets and host stars. The resulting strength of the stellar tide produces a coupling that is strong enough to reorient the spins of some host stars without causing catastrophic orbital evolution, thereby potentially explaining the observed trend in alignment between stellar spin and planetary orbital angular momentum. By isolating the sample whose spins should not have been altered in this model, we also show evidence for two different processes that contribute to the population of planets with short orbital periods. We apply our results to estimate the remaining lifetimes for short-period planets, examine the survival of planets around evolving stars, and determine the limits for circularization of planets with highly eccentric orbits. Our analysis suggests that the survival of circularized planets is strongly affected by the amount of heat dissipated, which is often large enough to lead to runaway orbital inflation and Roche lobe overflow. \textcopyright{} 2012.

  abstract = {We examine the effect of secular perturbations by giant planets on systems of multiple, lower mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars. We simulate the effects of forcing both eccentricity and inclination, separately and together. We compare our results to the statistics of the observed Kepler data and examine whether these results can be used to explain the observed excess of single transiting planets. We cannot explain the observed excess by pumping only inclination without driving most systems over the edge of dynamical instability. Thus, we expect the underlying planetary population for systems with a single transitting planet to contain an intrinsically low multiplicity population. We can explain the Kepler statistics and occurrence rates for R\textbackslash textless 2 Rearth planets with a perturber population consistent with that inferred from radial velocity surveys, but require too many giant planets if we wish to explain all planets with R \textbackslash textless 4 Rearth. These numbers can be brought into agreement if we posit the existence of an equivalent size population of planets below the RV detection limit (of characteristic mass 0.1 Mjupiter). This population would need to be dynamically hot to produce sufficiently strong perturbations and would leave the imprint of high obliquities amongst the surviving planets. Thus, an extensive sample of obliquities for low mass planets can help to indicate the presence of such a population. (...) Some of our simulations also produce planetary systems with planets that survive in the habitable zone but have no planets interior to them \textendash{} much as in the case of our Solar System. This suggests that such a configuration may not be altogether rare, but may occur around a few percent of FGK stars.},

This ratio is smaller for stars less massive than the Sun (because they evolve more slowly), and the width of the continuously habitable zone about a main sequence star is therefore a strong function of the initial stellar mass.

  abstract = {Using results and calibrations from a previous paper (Gullbring et al. 1997), we estimate disk accretion rates for pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus and Chamaeleon I molecular cloud complexes. The median accretion rate for T Tauri stars of age {$\sim$}1 Myr is {$\sim$}10-8 M{\.o} yr-1; the intrinsic scatter at a given age may be as large as 1 order of magnitude. There is a clear decline of mass accretion rates M dot with increasing age t among T Tauri stars. Representing this decline as M dot {$\sim$}t\^\{- eta \} , we estimate 1.5 \textbackslash textless{$\sim$} eta \textbackslash textless{$\sim$} 2.8; the large uncertainty is due to the wide range of accretion rates at a given age, the limited age range of the sample, and errors in estimating stellar ages and accretion luminosities. Adopting values of eta near the low end of this range, which are more likely given probable errors and the neglect of birthline age corrections, masses accreted during the T Tauri phase are roughly consistent with disk masses estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission. Similarity solutions for evolving, expanding disks are used to investigate observational constraints on disk properties employing a minimum of parameters. For an assumed power-law form of the disk viscosity with radius nu {$\sim$} R gamma , eta \textbackslash textgreater{$\sim$} 1.5 corresponds to gamma \textbackslash textgreater{$\sim$} 1. The limit gamma {$\sim$} 1 corresponds to a roughly constant " alpha " in the Shakura-Sunyaev (1973) viscosity parameterization; using current observed disk sizes, we estimate alpha {$\sim$} 10-2 (on scales {$\sim$}10-100 AU). Much of the observed variation in mass accretion rates can be accounted for by varying initial disk masses between 0.01 and 0.2 M{\.o}, but this result may be strongly affected by the presence of binary companion stars. These results emphasize the need for older samples of stars for studying disk evolution.},

  abstract = {The structure of planetary systems around their host stars depends on their initial formation conditions. Massive planets will likely be formed as a consequence of rapid migration of planetesimals and low-mass cores into specific trapping sites in protoplanetary discs. We present analytical modelling of inhomogeneities in protoplanetary discs around a variety of young stars - from Herbig Ae/Be to classical T Tauri and down to M stars - and show how they give rise to planet traps. The positions of these traps define the initial orbital distribution of multiple protoplanets. We investigate both corotation and Lindblad torques, and show that a new trap arises from the (entropy-related) corotation torque. This arises at that disc radius where disc heating changes from viscous to stellar irradiation dominated processes. We demonstrate that up to three traps (heat transitions, ice lines and dead zones) can exist in a single disc, and that they move differently as the disc accretion rate decreases with time. The interaction between the giant planets which grow in such traps may be a crucial ingredient for establishing planetary systems. We also demonstrate that the position of planet traps strongly depends on stellar masses and disc accretion rates. This indicates that host stars establish preferred scales of their planetary systems. We discuss the potential of planet traps induced by ice lines of various molecules such as water and CO, and estimate the maximum and minimum mass of planets which undergo type I migration. We finally apply our analyses to accounting for the initial conditions proposed in the Nice model for the origin of our Solar system. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors.

We consider the heavy-element content trend of observed exoplanets derived from improved measurements of mass and radius, and explore how this trend can be used as a tracer of their formation sites. Using gas accretion recipes obtained from detailed hydrodynamical simulations, we confirm that the disk-limited gas accretion regime is most important for reproducing the heavy-element content trend. Given that such a regime is specified by two characteristic masses of planets, we compute these masses as a function of the distance (\$r\$) from the central star, and then examine how the regime appears in the mass-semimajor axis diagram. Our results show that a plausible solid accretion region emerges at \$r \textbackslash backslashsimeq 0.6\$ au and expands with increasing \$r\$, using the conventional disk model. Given that exoplanets that possess the heavy-element content trend distribute currently near their central stars, our results imply the importance of planetary migration that would occur after solid accretion onto planets might be nearly completed at \$r \textbackslash backslashgeq 0.6\$ au. Self-consistent simulations would be needed to verify the predictions herein.},

The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents.Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass. This redistribution seems to be possible if it occurs at a formation stage of the nebula where the presence of large viscosities is expected.Finally, a comment is given on the initial condition of a collapsing interstellar cloud from which the solar nebula is formed at the end of the collapse.},

  abstract = {Observations of exoplanetary systems provide clues about the intrinsic distribution of planetary systems, their architectures, and how they formed. We develop a forward modeling framework for generating populations of planetary systems and "observed" catalogs by simulating the Kepler detection pipeline (SysSim). We compare our simulated catalogs to the Kepler DR25 catalog of planet candidates, updated to include revised stellar radii from Gaia DR2. We constrain our model based on the observed 1-D marginal distributions of orbital periods, period ratios, transit depths, transit depth ratios, transit durations, transit duration ratios, and transit multiplicities. Models assuming planets with independent periods and sizes do not adequately account for the properties of the multi-planet systems. Instead, a clustered point process model for exoplanet periods and sizes provides a significantly better description of the Kepler population, particularly the observed multiplicity and period ratio distributions. We find that \$0.56\^\{+0.18\}\_\{-0.15\}\$ of FGK stars have at least one planet larger than \$0.5 R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ between 3 and 300 days. Most of these planetary systems (\$\textbackslash backslashsim 98\textbackslash backslash\%\$) consist of one or two clusters with a median of three planets per cluster. We find that the Kepler dichotomy is evidence for a population of highly-inclined planetary systems and is unlikely to be solely due to a population of intrinsically single planet systems. We provide a large ensemble of simulated physical and observed catalogs of planetary systems from our models, as well as publicly available code for generating similar catalogs given user-defined parameters.},

Here, we extend the clustered model to explore correlations between planetary systems and their host star properties.

We confirm previous findings that the occurrence of these planetary systems rises significantly toward later type (redder) stars. The fraction of stars with planets increases from \$f\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm swpa\} = 0.32\_\{-0.11\}\^\{+0.12\}\$ for F2V dwarfs to \$f\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm swpa\} = 0.96\_\{-0.19\}\^\{+0.04\}\$ for mid K-dwarfs. About half (\$f\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm swpa\} = 0.57\_\{-0.10\}\^\{+0.14\}\$) of all solar-type (G2V) dwarfs harbor a planetary system between 3 and 300 days. This simple model can closely match the observed multiplicity distributions of both the bluer and redder halves in our sample, suggesting that the architectures of planetary systems around stars of different spectral types may be similar aside from a shift in the overall fraction of planet hosting stars.},

  abstract = {The angular momentum deficit (AMD) of a planetary system is a measure of its orbital excitation and a predictor of long-term stability. We adopt the AMD-stability criteria to constrain the orbital architectures for exoplanetary systems. Previously, He, Ford, \& Ragozzine (2019) (arXiv:1907.07773v2) showed through forward modelling (SysSim) that the observed multiplicity distribution can be well reproduced by two populations consisting of a low and a high mutual inclination component. Here, we show that a broad distribution of mutual inclinations arising from systems at the AMD-stability limit can also match the observed Kepler population. We show that distributing a planetary system's maximum AMD amongst its planets results in a multiplicity-dependent distribution of eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Systems with intrinsically more planets have lower median eccentricities and mutual inclinations, and this trend is well described by power-law functions of the intrinsic planet multiplicity (\$n\$): \$\textbackslash backslashtilde\{\textbackslash backslashmu\}\_\{e,n\} \textbackslash backslashpropto n\^\{-1.74\_\{-0.07\}\^\{+0.11\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashtilde\{\textbackslash backslashmu\}\_\{i,n\} \textbackslash backslashpropto n\^\{-1.73\_\{-0.08\}\^\{+0.09\}\}\$, where \$\textbackslash backslashtilde\{\textbackslash backslashmu\}\_\{e,n\}\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashtilde\{\textbackslash backslashmu\}\_\{i,n\}\$ are the medians of the eccentricity and inclination distributions. We also find that intrinsic single planets have higher eccentricities (\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\_\{e,1\} \textbackslash backslashsim 0.25\$) than multi-planet systems, and that the trends with multiplicity appear in the observed distributions of period-normalized transit duration ratios. We show that the observed preferences for planet size orderings and uniform spacings are more extreme than what can be produced by the detection biases of the Kepler mission alone. Finally, we find that for systems with detected transiting planets between 5 and 10d, there is another planet with a greater RV signal \$\textbackslash backslashsimeq{$\sim$}53\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the time.},

  abstract = {Population studies of Kepler's multi-planet systems have revealed a surprising degree of structure in their underlying architectures. Information from a detected transiting planet can be combined with a population model to make predictions about the presence and properties of additional planets in the system. Using a statistical model for the distribution of planetary systems (He et al. 2020; arXiv:2007.14473), we compute the conditional occurrence of planets as a function of the period and radius of Kepler\textendash detectable planets. About half (\$0.52 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.03\$) of the time, the detected planet is not the planet with the largest semi-amplitude \$K\$ in the system, so efforts to measure the mass of the transiting planet with RV follow-up will have to contend with additional planetary signals in the data. We simulate RV observations to show that assuming a single\textendash planet model to measure the \$K\$ of the transiting planet often requires significantly more observations than in the ideal case with no additional planets, due to the systematic errors from unseen planet companions. Our results show that planets around 10-day periods with \$K\$ close to the single\textendash measurement RV precision (\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\_\{1,\textbackslash backslashrm obs\}\$) typically require \$\textbackslash backslashsim 100\$ observations to measure their \$K\$ to within 20\% error. For a next generation RV instrument achieving \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\_\{1,\textbackslash backslashrm obs\} = 10\$ cm/s, about \$\textbackslash backslashsim 200\$ (\$600\$) observations are needed to measure the \$K\$ of a transiting Venus in a Kepler\textendash like system to better than 20\% (10\%) error, which is \$\textbackslash backslashsim 2.3\$ times as many as what would be necessary for a Venus without any planetary companions.},

This work is structured as follows. Part I gives a broad introduction to the field of extrasolar moons with special attention to their formation, detection, and habitability. Part II presents the cumulative part of this thesis with a total of 16 peer-reviewed journal publications listing the author of this thesis as a lead author, and six publications with the author of this thesis as a co-author. Part III shares some insights into our ongoing research on exomoons in collaboration with master student Anina Timmermann at the Georg-August University of G\$\textbackslash backslash\$"ottingen and former PhD student Kai Rodenbeck at the International Max Planck Research School for Solar System Science and the University of G\$\textbackslash backslash\$"ottingen.

  abstract = {Context. Little is known about the interaction between atmospheres and crusts of exoplanets so far, but future space missions and ground-based instruments are expected to detect molecular features in the spectra of hot rocky exoplanets. Aims. We aim to understand the composition of the gas in an exoplanet atmosphere which is in equilibrium with a planetary crust. Methods. The molecular composition of the gas above a surface made of a mixture of solid and liquid materials is determined by assuming phase equilibrium for given pressure, temperature and element abundances. We study total element abundances that represent different parts of the Earth's crust (Continental Crust, Bulk Silicate Earth, Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt), CI chondrites and abundances measured in polluted white dwarfs. Results. For temperatures between {$\sim$} 600 K and {$\sim$} 3500 K, the near-crust atmospheres of all considered total element abundances are mainly composed of H 2 O, CO 2 , SO 2 and in some cases of O 2 and H 2. For temperatures 500 K, only N 2-rich or CH 4-rich atmospheres remain. For 3500 K, the atmospheric gas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, Fe), metal oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO, CaO, AlO, FeO) and some metal hydroxides (KOH, NaOH). The inclusion of phyllosilicates as potential condensed species is crucial for lower temperatures, as they can remove water from the gas phase below about 700 K and inhibit the presence of liquid water. Conclusions. Measurements of the atmospheric composition could, in principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet crusts. H 2 O, O 2 and CH 4 are natural products from the outgassing of different kinds of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as biomarkers, but do emerge naturally as result of the thermodynamic interaction between crust and atmosphere. Only the simultaneous detection of all three molecules might be a sufficient biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical equilibrium.},

Here, we apply their pipeline, with minor modifications, to a larger sample and use the updated stellar parameters from Gaia DR2. The latter boosts the sizes for the majority of the planet candidates found by FM16, invalidating a number of them as false positives. We identify 12 good candidates, including 2 new ones. All but one have periods from 2 to 10 years, and sizes from 0.4 to 1.26 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$. We report two main findings. First, we find a total occurrence rate of \$0.43\_\{-0.11\}\^\{+0.13\}\$ planets per Sun-like star in the outer region, consistent with results from radial-velocity and microlensing surveys. Neptune-sized planets are a few times more common than Jupiter-sized ones, as is also derived by microlensing studies. Second, 5 out of our 12 candidates orbit stars with known transiting planets at shorter periods, including one with 5 inner planets.

Assuming spin-orbit alignment, this can be done by considering stars that have higher probability to be oriented nearly equator-on (inclination close to 90\^\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$circ\}). Methods. We use activity-rotation velocity relations for low-mass stars with a convective envelope to study the dependence of the position in the activity-vsini diagram on the stellar axis inclination. We compose a catalog of G-, K-, M-type main sequence simulated stars using isochrones, an isotropic inclination distribution and empirical relations to obtain their rotation periods and activity indexes. Then the activity - vsini diagram is filled and statistics are applied to trace the areas containing the higher ratio of stars with inclinations above 80\^\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$circ\}. A similar statistics is applied to stars from real catalogs with log(R'HK) and vsini data to find their probability of being equator-on. Results. We present the method used to generate the simulated star catalog and the subsequent statistics to find the highly inclined stars from real catalogs using the activity - vsini diagram. Several catalogs from the literature are analysed and a subsample of stars with the highest probability of being equator-on is presented. Conclusions. Assuming spin-orbit alignment, the efficiency of an exoplanet transit search in the resulting subsample of probably highly inclined stars is estimated to be two to three times higher than with a global search with no preselection.},

However, the importance of other elements in predicting giant planet occurrence is less certain despite their central role in shaping internal planetary structure. In order to understand the subtle, yet crucial way that non-iron elements may influence the formation of giant planets, we apply advances in data-driven research to the Hypatia Catalog (Hinkel et al. 2014) of stellar abundances. We designed a machine learning algorithm to analyze stellar abundance patterns of known host stars, similar to how online streaming services use viewer history to recommend movies, to determine those elements important in identifying potential giant exoplanet host stars. We analyzed a variety of scenarios involving different groups of elements, namely volatiles (C, O), lithophiles (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y), siderophiles (Cr, Co, Ni), and Fe. Here we show that oxygen, carbon, and sodium, besides iron, are influential indicators of a giant planet and we present a list of {$\sim$}350 stars that have a {$\geq$}90\% probability of hosting a giant exoplanet. We anticipate that our findings will revolutionize the determination of interior structure models for both giant and terrestrial planets. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how this planet-finding algorithm can be used to guide future target lists, such as the TESS, CHEOPS, JWST, and WFIRST missions.},

  abstract = {We present a new method to detect planetary transits from time-series photometry, the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm. TLS searches for transit-like features while taking the stellar limb darkening and planetary ingress and egress into account. We have optimized TLS for both signal detection efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational speed. TLS analyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded light curve. We compensate for the higher computational load by (i.) using algorithms like "Mergesort" (for the trial orbital phases) and by (ii.) restricting the trial transit durations to a smaller range that encompasses all known planets, and using stellar density priors where available. A typical K2 light curve, including 80d of observations at a cadence of 30min, can be searched with TLS in {$\sim$}10s real time on a standard laptop computer, as fast as the widely used Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm. We perform a transit injection-retrieval experiment of Earth-sized planets around sun-like stars using synthetic light curves with 110ppm white noise per 30min cadence, corresponding to a photometrically quiet KP=12 star observed with Kepler. We determine the SDE thresholds for both BLS and TLS to reach a false positive rate of 1\% to be SDE{$\sim$}7 in both cases. The resulting true positive (or recovery) rates are {$\sim$}93\% for TLS and {$\sim$}76\% for BLS, implying more reliable detections with TLS. We also test TLS with the K2 light curve of the TRAPPIST-1 system and find six of seven Earth-sized planets using an iterative search for increasingly lower signal detection efficiency, the phase-folded transit of the seventh planet being affected by a stellar flare. TLS is more reliable than BLS in finding any kind of transiting planet but it is particularly suited for the detection of small planets in long time series from Kepler, TESS, and PLATO. We make our Python implementation of TLS publicly available.},

Thus, the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observed value of MT sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a distribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e., the presumptive prior distribution. Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn depends on the intrinsic distribution of MT for the exoplanet population being studied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several "toy models" for the intrinsic distribution of MT , on which we have significant information from available RV data in some mass ranges but little or none in others. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for simple power-law distributions of MT , the median value of sin(i) in an observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the 0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power law in the range between -2 and +1, respectively. Over the same range of indices, the 95\% confidence interval on MT varies from 1.0001-2.405 ({$\alpha$} = -2) to 1.13-94.34 ({$\alpha$} = +2) times larger than MT sin(i) due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. More complex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of MT yield more complicated and somewhat unintuitive posterior sin(i) distributions. In particular, if the MT distribution contains any characteristic mass scale Mc , the posterior sin(i) distribution will depend on the ratio of MT sin(i) to Mc , often in a non-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets, both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i) factor as more than a "numerical constant of order unity" with simple and well-understood statistical properties. We argue that reports of MT sin(i) determinations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding confidence bounds on MT at, say, the 95\% level based on an explicitly stated assumed form of the true MT distribution in order to reflect more accurately the mass uncertainties associated with RV studies. \textcopyright{} 2011.

With regards to the planetary systems, we select those with four or more planets and analyse their configurations in terms of stability (via Hill radii), compactness, and size variations. We find that most planetary pairs are stable, and that the compactness correlates to the size variation: More compact systems have more similarly sized planets and vice versa. We also investigate the spectral energy distributions of the stars hosting multiple exoplanetary systems, seeking infra-red excesses that could indicate the presence of debris disks. These disks would be leftovers from the planetary formation process, and could be considered as analogues of the Solar System's Asteroid or Kuiper belts. We identify potential candidates for disks that are good targets for far infra-red follow-up observations to confirm their existence.},

However, new techniques using near infrared spectra show promising results. Using these, we determine stellar parameters and metallicities for a sample of 16 M-dwarf stars, 11 of which host planets, with near-infrared spectra from the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). We find that M-dwarfs with planets are preferentially metal-rich compared to those without planets. This result, based on GNIRS spectra, is supported by the analysis of a relatively larger sample of M stars with planets (18 in total) and a control sample of 213 M stars without known planets, obtained from the catalogue of Terrien et al. (2015). This, on the one hand, coincides with the trend (not only for M- but also for solar-type stars) reported in the literature and, on the other hand, demonstrates the utility of GNIRS spectra to obtain reliable stellar parameters of M stars. We also find that M dwarfs that harbor giant planets are preferentially more metallic than those associated with low-mass planets (Neptune or super-Earth type). This trend also agrees with that previously reported for solar-type stars. These results would favor the core accretion model for planetary formation.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

As a consequence, the presence of such a correlation is crucial in selecting the targets with the lowest RV jitter for efficient RV follow-up of exoplanetary candidates. Studies of this type are also crucial to design optimized observational strategies to mitigate RV jitter when searching for Earth-mass exoplanets. Our goal is to assess the correlation between high-precision photometric variability measurements and high-precision RV jitter over different time scales. We analyze 171 G, K, and M stars with available TESS high precision photometric time-series and HARPS precise RVs. We derived the stellar parameters for the stars in our sample and measured the RV jitter and photometric variability. We also estimated chromospheric Ca II H \$\textbackslash backslash\&\$ K activity indicator \$log(R' \_\{HK\})\$, \$\textbackslash backslashtextit\{v sin i\}\$, and the stellar rotational period. Finally, we evaluate how different stellar parameters and a RV sampling subset can have an impact on the potential correlations. We find a varying correlation between the photometric variability and RV jitter as function of time intervals between the TESS photometric observation and HARPS RV. As the time intervals of the observations considered for the analysis increases, the correlation value and significance becomes smaller and weaker, to the point that it becomes negligible. We also find that for stars with a photometric variability above 6.5 ppt the correlation is significantly stronger. We show that such a result can be due to the transition between the spot-dominated and the faculae-dominated regime. We quantified the correlations and updated the relationship between chromospheric Ca II H \$\textbackslash backslash\&\$ K activity indicator \$log(R' \_\{HK\})\$ and RV jitter.},

A nearly static, ionized, isothermal 104 K atmosphere forms above the neutral disk for disk radii r less than rg = 1015 M1 cm, where M* = 10 solar mass M1 is the stellar mass. For r approximately greater than rg the diffuse field created by hydrogen recombinations to the ground state in the photoionized gas above the disk produces a steady evaporation at the surface of the disk, and this H II gas flows freely out to the ISM (the 'disk wind'). The detailed structure depends on the mass-loss rate dot-Mw of the fast, approximately greater than 1000 km/sec, stellar wind from the massive star. A critical mass-loss rate dot-Mcr is defined such that the ram pressure of the stellar wind equals the thermal pressure of the H II atmosphere at rg. In the weak stellar wind solution, dot-Mw less than dot-Mcr, the diffuse photons from the atmosphere above rg produce a photoevaporative mass-loss rate from the disk at r approximately greater than rg of order 1 x 10-5(Phi49)1/2(M1)1/2 solar mass/year, where Phii = 1049 Phi49/sec. The resulting slow (10 to 50 km/sec) ionized outflow, which persists for approximately greater than 105 year for disk masses Md approximately 0.3 M*, may explain the observational characteri stics of unresolved, ultracompact H II regions. In the strong stellar wind solution, dot-Mw greater than dot-Mcr, the ram pressure of the stellar wind blows down the atmosphere for r less than rg and allows the stellar photons to penetrate to greater radii and smaller heights. A slow, ionized outflow produced mainly by diffuse photons is again created for r less than rg; however, it is now dominated by the flow at rw(greater than rg), the radius at which the stellar wind ram pressure equals the thermal pressure in the evaporating flow. The mass-loss rate from the disk is of order 6 x 10-5dot-Mw-6 vw8(Phi 49)-1/2 solar mass/year, where dot-Mw-6 = Mw/10-6 solar mass/year and vw8 = vw/1000 km/sec is the stellar wind velocity. The resulting outflow, which also persists for approximately greater than 105 year may explain many of the more extended (r approximately greater than 1016 cm) ultracompact H II regions. Both the weak-wind and the strong-wind models depend entirely on stellar parameters Phii, M*, dot-Mw) and are independent of disk parameters as long as an extended r much greater than (rg), neutral disk exists. We compare both weak-wind and strong-wind model results to the observed radio free-free spectra and luminosities of ultracompact H II regions and to the interesting source MWC 349.},

  abstract = {As the first successful technique used to detect exoplanets orbiting distant stars, the Radial Velocity Method aims to detect a periodic Doppler shift in a star's spectrum. We introduce a new, mathematically rigorous, approach to detect such a signal that accounts for functional relationships of neighboring wavelengths, minimizes the role of wavelength interpolation, accounts for heteroskedastic noise, and easily allows for statistical inference. Using Hermite-Gaussian functions, we show that the problem of detecting a Doppler shift in the spectrum can be reduced to linear regression in many settings. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed method is able to accurately estimate an individual spectrum's radial velocity with precision below 0.3 m/s. Furthermore, the new method outperforms the traditional Cross-Correlation Function approach by reducing the root mean squared error up to 15 cm/s. The proposed method is also demonstrated on a new set of observations from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES) for the star 51 Pegasi, and successfully recovers estimates that agree well with previous studies of this planetary system. Data and Python3 code associated with this work can be found at https://github.com/parkerholzer/hgrv\_method. The method is also implemented in the open source R package rvmethod.},

  abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius, orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50 days around solar-type (GK) stars. These results are based on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 R {$\oplus$} . For each of the 156,000 target stars, we assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R p , and orbital period, P , using a measure of the detection efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] \{sstarf\} / a . We consider first Kepler target stars within the "solar subset" having T eff = 4100-6100 K, log g = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp \textbackslash textless 15 mag, i.e., bright, main-sequence GK stars. We include only those stars having photometric noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R {$\oplus$} . We count planets in small domains of R p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R {$\oplus$} ) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days, {$\sim$}0.25 AU) in our study. For P \textbackslash textless 50 days, the distribution of planet radii is given by a power law, df / d log R = k R R {$\alpha$} with k R = 2.9 +0.5 \textendash{} 0.4 , {$\alpha$} = \textendash 1.92 {$\pm$} 0.11, and R {$\equiv$} R p / R {$\oplus$} . This rapid increase in planet occurrence with decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a desert at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets with orbital periods shorter than 2 days are extremely rare; for R p \textbackslash textgreater 2 R {$\oplus$} we measure an occurrence of less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods less than 50 days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 {$\pm$} 0.008, 0.023 {$\pm$} 0.003, and 0.013 {$\pm$} 0.002 planets per star for planets with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R {$\oplus$} , in agreement with Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P 0 . For smaller planets, P 0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a broader stellar T eff range of 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R {$\oplus$} planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T eff , with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool stars (3600-4100 K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100 K).},

  abstract = {Disc-driven planet migration is integral to the formation of planetary systems. In standard, gas-dominated protoplanetary discs, low-mass planets or planetary cores undergo rapid inwards migration and are lost to the central star. However, several recent studies indicate that the solid component in protoplanetary discs can have a significant dynamical effect on disc-planet interaction, especially when the solid-to-gas mass ratio approaches unity or larger and the dust-on-gas drag forces become significant. As there are several ways to raise the solid abundance in protoplanetary discs, for example through disc winds and dust-trapping in pressure bumps, it is important to understand how planets migrate through a dusty environment. To this end, we study planet migration in dust-rich discs via a systematic set of high-resolution, two-dimensional numerical simulations. We show that the inwards migration of low-mass planets can be slowed down by dusty dynamical corotation torques. We also identify a new regime of stochastic migration applicable to discs with dust-to-gas mass ratios \$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim 0.3\$ and particle Stokes numbers \$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim 0.03\$. In these cases, disc-planet interaction leads to the continuous development of small-scale, intense dust vortices that scatter the planet, which can potentially halt or even reverse the inwards planet migration. We briefly discuss the observational implications of our results and highlight directions for future work.},

For this study we adopt a simple 2-D grid in planet radius and orbital period as our model and apply our algorithm to estimate occurrence rates for Q1-Q16 planet candidates orbiting around solar-type stars. We arrive at significantly increased planet occurrence rates for small planet candidates (\$R\_p\textbackslash textless1.25 R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$) at larger orbital periods (\$P\textbackslash textgreater80\$d) compared to the rates estimated by the more common inverse detection efficiency method. Our improved methodology estimates that the occurrence rate density of small planet candidates in the habitable zone of solar-type stars is \$1.6\^\{+1.2\}\_\{-0.5\}\$ per factor of 2 in planet radius and orbital period. Additionally, we observe a local minimum in the occurrence rate for strong planet candidates marginalized over orbital period between 1.5 and 2\$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ that is consistent with previous studies. For future improvements, the forward modeling approach of ABC is ideally suited to incorporating multiple populations, such as planets, astrophysical false positives and pipeline false alarms, to provide accurate planet occurrence rates and uncertainties. Furthermore, ABC provides a practical statistical framework for answering complex questions (e.g., frequency of different planetary architectures) and providing sound uncertainties, even in the face of complex selection effects, observational biases, and follow-up strategies. In summary, ABC offers a powerful tool for accurately characterizing a wide variety of astrophysical populations.},

We incorporate additional Kepler data products to accurately characterize the efficiency of planets being recognized as a "threshold crossing events" (TCE) by Kepler's Transiting Planet Search pipeline and labeled as a planet candidate by the robovetter. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we derive planet occurrence rates for a wide range of planet sizes and orbital periods.

This work incorporates the final Kepler DR25 planet candidate catalogue and data products and augments them with updated stellar properties using Gaia DR2 and 2MASS point source catalogue. We apply a set of selection criteria to select a sample of 1746 Kepler M dwarf targets that host 89 associated planet candidates. These early-type M dwarfs and late K dwarfs were selected from cross-referenced targets using several photometric quality flags from Gaia DR2 and colour\textendash magnitude cuts using 2MASS magnitudes.

For example, we find an occurrence rate of \$4.2\^\{+0.6\}\_\{-0.6\}\$ or \$8.4\^\{+1.2\}\_\{-1.1\}\$ planets per M dwarf (integrating over Rp = 0.5\textendash 4 R{$\oplus$} and P = 0.5\textendash 256 d) for our two choices of prior. These occurrence rates are greater than those for FGK dwarf target when compared at the same range of orbital periods, but similar to occurrence rates when computed as a function of equivalent stellar insolation. Combining our result with recent studies of exoplanet architectures indicates that most, and potentially all, early-type M dwarfs harbour planetary systems.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that the inner region of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is governed by wind-driven accretion, and the resulting accretion flow showing complex vertical profiles. Such complex flow structures are further enhanced due to the Hall effect, especially when the background magnetic field is aligned with disk rotation. We investigate how such flow structures impact global dust transport via Monte-Carlo simulations, focusing on two scenarios. In the first scenario, the toroidal magnetic field is maximized in the miplane, leading to accretion and decretion flows above and below. In the second scenario, the toroidal field changes sign across the midplane, leading to an accretion flow at the disk midplane, with decretion flows above and below. We find that in both cases, the contribution from additional gas flows can still be accurately incorporated into the advection-diffusion framework for vertically-integrated dust transport, with enhanced dust radial diffusion up to an effective \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\^\{\textbackslash backslashrm eff\}\textbackslash backslashsim10\^\{-2\}\$ for strongly coupled dust, even when background turbulence is weak \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\textbackslash textless10\^\{-4\}\$. Dust radial drift is also modestly enhanced in the second scenario. We provide a general analytical theory that accurately reproduces our simulation results, thus establishing a framework to model global dust transport that realistically incorporates vertical gas flow structures. We also note that the theory is equally applicable to the transport of chemical species.},

Hot Jupiters, with the singular exception of WASP-47b, do not have any detectable inner or outer planetary companions (with periods inward of 50 days and sizes down to \$2 R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Earth\}\$). Restricting ourselves to inner companions, our limits reach down to \$1 R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Earth\}\$. In stark contrast, half of the warm Jupiters are closely flanked by small companions. Statistically, the companion fractions for hot and warm Jupiters are mutually exclusive, particularly in regard to inner companions. The high companion fraction of warm Jupiters also yields clues to their formation. The warm Jupiters that have close-by siblings should have low orbital eccentricities and low mutual inclinations. The orbital configurations of these systems are reminiscent of those of the low-mass, close-in planetary systems abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission. This, and other arguments, lead us to propose that these warm Jupiters are formed in-situ. There are indications that there may be a second population of warm Jupiters with different characteristics. In this picture, WASP-47b could be regarded as the extending tail of the in-situ warm Jupiters into the hot Jupiter region, and does not represent the generic formation route for hot Jupiters.},

The formation of the early disk is modeled as the result of the gravitational collapse of an isothermal molecular cloud. The disk's viscous evolution is integrated according to two parameterizations of turbulence: the classical {$\alpha$} representation and a {$\beta$} parameterization, representative of non-linear turbulence driven by the keplerian shear. We apply the model to DM Tau and GM Aur, two classical T-Tauri stars with relatively well-characterized disks, retrieving the evolution of their surface density with time. We perform a systematic Monte-Carlo exploration of the parameter space (i.e. values of the {$\alpha$}-{$\beta$} parameters, and of the temperature and rotation rate in the molecular cloud) to find the values that are compatible with the observed disk surface density distribution, star and disk mass, age and present accretion rate. We find that the observations for DM Tau require 0.001 \textbackslash textless {$\alpha$} \textbackslash textless 0.1 or 2 \texttimes{} 10-5 \textbackslash textless {$\beta$} \textbackslash textless 5 \texttimes{} 10-4.

This is to be compared to studies of the variations of accretion rates of T-Tauri stars versus age that mostly probe the inner disks, but also yield values of {$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 0.01.

  abstract = {Direct imaging (DI) surveys suggest that gas giants beyond 20 AU are rare around FGK stars. However, it is not clear what this means for the formation frequency of Gravitational Instability (GI) protoplanets due to uncertainties in gap opening and migration efficiency. Here we combine state-of-the-art calculations of homogeneous planet contraction with a population synthesis code. We find DI constraints to be satisfied if protoplanet formation by GI occurs in tens of percent of systems if protoplanets `super migrate' to small separations. In contrast, GI may occur in only a few percent of systems if protoplanets remain stranded at wide orbits because their migration is `quenched' by efficient gap opening. We then use the frequency of massive giants in radial velocity surveys inside 5 AU to break this degeneracy - observations recently showed that this population does not correlate with the host star metallicity and is therefore suspected to have formed via GI followed by inward migration. We find that only the super-migration scenario can sufficiently explain this population whilst simultaneously satisfying the DI constraints and producing the right mass spectrum of planets inside 5 AU. If massive gas-giants inside 5 AU formed via GI, then our models imply that migration must be efficient and that the formation of GI protoplanets occurs in at least a tens of percent of systems.},

  abstract = {Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, choosing speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect the make-up of the final cohort. We propose a new algorithm, Entrofy, designed to be part of a larger decision making strategy aimed at making cohort selection as just, quantitative, transparent, and accountable as possible. We suggest this algorithm be embedded in a two-step selection procedure. First, all application materials are stripped of markers of identity that could induce conscious or sub-conscious bias. During blind review, the committee selects all applicants, submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria. This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool via a new algorithm and software tool. Entrofy optimizes differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human committee. Criteria could include gender, academic discipline, experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable characteristics. The Entrofy algorithm yields the computational maximization of diversity by solving the tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show how Entrofy selects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study. This cohort selection process allows human judgment to prevail when assessing merit, but assigns the assessment of diversity to a computational process less likely to be beset by human bias. Importantly, the stage at which diversity assessments occur is fully transparent and auditable with Entrofy. Splitting merit and diversity considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected.},

A signal with a periodicity of 0.676 days and a semi-amplitude of {$\sim$}10 m/s is consistent with the rotation period measured over much shorter time spans by previous spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric studies, confirming the presence of surface features on this A0 star. The timescale of evolution of these features can provide insight into the mechanism that sustains the weak magnetic fields in normal A type stars. Modeling the radial velocities with a Gaussian process using a quasi-periodic kernel suggests that the characteristic spot evolution timescale is {$\sim$}180 days, though we cannot exclude the possibility that it is much longer. Such long timescales may indicate the presence of failed fossil magnetic fields on Vega. TESS data reveal Vega's photometric rotational modulation for the first time, with a total amplitude of only 10 ppm, and a comparison of the spectroscopic and photometric amplitudes suggest the surface features may be dominated by bright plages rather than dark spots. For the shortest orbital periods, transit and radial velocity injection recovery tests exclude the presence of transiting planets larger than 2 Earth radii and most non-transiting giant planets. At long periods, we combine our radial velocities with direct imaging from the literature to produce detection limits for Vegan planets and brown dwarfs out to distances of 15 au. Finally, we detect a candidate radial velocity signal with a period of 2.43 days and a semi-amplitude of 6 m/s. If caused by an orbiting companion, its minimum mass would be {$\sim$}20 Earth masses; because of Vega's pole-on orientation, this would correspond to a Jovian planet if the orbit is aligned with the stellar spin. We discuss the prospects for confirmation of this candidate planet.},

We find a total of 10 planets with mass ratios \$q\textbackslash textless2\textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^\{-4\}\$, including five newly discovered planets, one planet that was reported in Paper I, and recovery of four previously discovered planets. One of the new planets, OGLE-2018-BLG-0977Lb, is in a planetary-caustic event, while the other four (OGLE-2018-BLG-0506Lb, OGLE-2018-BLG-0516Lb, OGLE-2019-BLG-1492Lb, and KMT-2019-BLG-0253) are revealed by a ``dip'' in the light curve as the source crosses the host-planet axis on the opposite side of the planet. These subtle signals were missed in previous by-eye searches. The planet-host separations (scaled to the Einstein radius), \$s\$, and planet-host mass ratios, \$q\$, are, respectively, \$(s,q\textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^5) = (0.88, 4.1)\$, \$(0.96\textbackslash backslashpm 0.10, 8.3)\$, \$(0.94\textbackslash backslashpm 0.07, 13)\$, \$(0.97\textbackslash backslashpm 0.07, 18)\$, and \$(0.97\textbackslash backslashpm0.04,4.1)\$, where the ``\$\textbackslash backslashpm\$'' indicates a discrete degeneracy.

Together with the two planets previously reported with \$q\textbackslash backslashsim 10\^\{-5\}\$ from the 2018-2019 non-prime KMT fields, this result suggests that planets toward the bottom of this mass-ratio range may be more common than previously believed.},

  abstract = {Context. Streaming instability is a possible mechanism to form icy planetesimals. It requires special local conditions such as a high solid-to-gas ratio at the midplane and typically more than a centimeter in size (Stokes number \textbackslash textgreater0.01). Silicate grains cannot grow to such a size through pairwise collisions. It is important to clarify where and when rocky and icy planetesimals are formed in a viscously evolving disk. Aims. We wish to understand how local runaway pile-up of solids (silicate and water ice) occurs inside or outside the snow line. Methods. We assumed an icy pebble contains micron-sized silicate grains that are uniformly mixed with ice and are released during the ice sublimation. Using a local one-dimensional code, we solved the radial drift and the turbulent diffusion of solids and the water vapor, taking account of their sublimation and condensation around the snow line. We systematically investigated the effects of back-reactions of solids to gas on the radial drift and diffusion of solids, scale height evolution of the released silicate particles, and possible differences in effective viscous parameters between those for turbulent diffusion ({$\alpha$}tur) and those for the gas accretion rate onto the central star ({$\alpha$}acc). We also studied the dependence on the ratio of the solid mass flux to the gas (Fp/g). Results. We show that the favorable locations for the pile-up of silicate grains and icy pebbles are the regions in the proximity of, both inside and outside, the water snow line, respectively. We find that runaway pile-ups occur when both the back-reactions for radial drift and diffusion are included. In the case with only the back-reaction for the radial drift, runaway pile-up is not found except in extremely high pebble flux, while the condition of streaming instability can be satisfied for relatively large Fp/g as found in the past literature. If the back-reaction for radial diffusion is considered, the runaway pile-up occurs for a reasonable value of pebble flux. The runaway pile-up of silicate grains that would lead to formation of rocky planetesimals occurs for {$\alpha$}tur {$\geq\geq$} {$\alpha$}acc, while the runaway pile-up of icy pebbles is favored for {$\alpha$}tur {$\sim$} {$\alpha$}acc. Based on these results, we discuss timings and locations of rocky and icy planetesimals in an evolving disk.},

  abstract = {Context. Forming planetesimals is a major challenge in our current understanding of planet formation. Around the snow line, icy pebbles and silicate dust may locally pile up and form icy and rocky planetesimals via a streaming instability and/or gravitational instability. The scale heights of both pebbles and silicate dust released from sublimating pebbles are critical parameters that regulate the midplane concentrations of solids. Aims. Here, using a realistic description of the scale height of silicate dust and that of pebbles, we wish to understand disk conditions for which a local runaway pile-up of solids (silicate dust or icy pebbles) occurs inside or outside the snow line. Methods. We performed 1D diffusion-advection simulations that include the back-reaction (the inertia) to radial drift and diffusion of icy pebbles and silicate dust, ice sublimation, the release of silicate dust, and their recycling through the recondensation and sticking onto pebbles outside the snow line. We used a realistic description of the scale height of silicate dust obtained from a companion paper and that of pebbles including the effects of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We study the dependence of solid pile-up on distinct effective viscous parameters for turbulent diffusions in the radial and vertical directions ({$\alpha$}Dr and {$\alpha$}Dz) and for the gas accretion to the star ({$\alpha$}acc) as well as that on the pebble-to-gas mass flux (Fp/g). Results. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we derive the sublimation width of drifting icy pebbles which is a critical parameter to characterize the pile-up of silicate dust and pebbles around the snow line. We identify a parameter space (in the Fp/g - {$\alpha$}acc - {$\alpha$}Dz(= {$\alpha$}Dr) space) where pebbles no longer drift inward to reach the snow line due to the back-reaction that slows down the radial velocity of pebbles (we call this the "no-drift"region). We show that the pile-up of solids around the snow line occurs in a broader range of parameters for {$\alpha$}acc = 10-3 than for {$\alpha$}acc = 10-2. Above a critical Fp/g value, the runaway pile-up of silicate dust inside the snow line is favored for {$\alpha$}Dr/ {$\alpha$}acc {$\ll$} 1, while that of pebbles outside the snow line is favored for {$\alpha$}Dr/ {$\alpha$}acc {$\sim$} 1. Our results imply that a distinct evolutionary path in the {$\alpha$}acc - {$\alpha$}Dr - {$\alpha$}Dz - Fp/g space could produce a diversity of outcomes in terms of planetesimal formation around the snow line.},

These protoplanets migrate and attain their asymptotic semimajor axis a through tidal interaction with their nascent disk. Based on the observed properties of protostellar disks, we generate an Mp-a distribution. Our results reproduce the observed lack of planets with intermediate mass Mp=10-100 M{$\oplus$} and a\textbackslash textless{$\sim$}3 AU and with large mass Mp\textbackslash textgreater{$\sim$}103 M{$\oplus$} and a\textbackslash textless{$\sim$}0.2 AU. Based on the simulated Mp-a distributions, we also evaluate the metallicity dependence of the fraction of stars harboring planets that are detectable with current radial velocity surveys. If protostellar disks attain the same fraction of heavy elements as contained in their host stars, the detection probability around metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced because protoplanetary cores formed in them can grow to several Earth masses prior to their depletion. These large masses are required for the cores to initiate rapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. The theoretically extrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the observations. This correlation does not arise naturally in the gravitational-instability scenario. We also suggest other metallicity dependences of the planet distributions that can be tested by ongoing observations.},

We adopt a working model for nascent protostellar disks with a wide variety of surface density distributions in order to explore the range of diversity among extra solar planetary systems. If some cores can acquire more mass than a critical value of several Earth masses during the persistence of the disk gas, they would be able to rapidly accrete gas and evolve into gas giant planets. The gas accretion process is initially regulated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the planets' gas envelope. Based on the assumption that the exponential decay of the disk-gas mass occurs on the time scales \$\textbackslash backslashsim 10\^\{6\}-10\^\{7\}\$ years and that the disk mass distribution is comparable to those inferred from the observations of circumstellar disks of T Tauri stars, we carry out simulations to predict the distributions of masses and semi major axes of extra solar planets. Since planets' masses grow rapidly from \$10 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ to \$100 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$, the gas giant planets rarely form with asymptotic masses in this intermediate range. Our model predicts a paucity of extra solar planets with mass in the range 10-\$100 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ and semi major axis less than 3AU. We refer to this deficit as a ``planet desert''. The effect of migration is to sharpen the boundaries and to enhance the contrast of the planet desert. The mass and semi major axis distributions generated in our simulations for the gas giants are consistent with those of the known extra solar planets.},

Based on the sequential accretion hypothesis and the standard theory of gap formation and orbital migration, we show that around M dwarf stars, close-in Neptune-mass ice-giant planets may be relatively common, while close-in Jupiter-mass gas-giant planets are relatively rare. The mass distribution of close-in planets generally has two peaks at about Neptune mass and Jupiter mass. The lower-mass peak takes the maximum frequency for M dwarfs. Around more massive solar-type stars (G dwarfs), the higher-mass peak is much more pronounced. These are because planets tend to undergo type II migration after fully accreting gas around G dwarfs while they tend to migrate faster than gas accretion around M stars. Close-in Neptune-mass planets may also exist around G dwarfs, though they tend to be mostly composed of silicates and iron cores and their frequency is expected to be much smaller than that of Neptune-mass planets around M dwarfs and that of gas giants around G dwarfs. We also show that the conditions for planets' migration due to their tidal interaction with the disk and the stellar-mass dependence in the disk-mass distribution can be calibrated by the mass distribution of short-period planets around host stars with various masses.},

  abstract = {In a further development of a deterministic planet-formation model (Ida \& Lin 2004), we consider the effect of type-I migration of protoplanetary embryos due to their tidal interaction with their nascent disks. During the early embedded phase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regions interior to the ice line, uninhibited type-I migration leads to their efficient self-clearing. But, embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals at increasingly large radii, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channel of heavy element accretion onto their host stars. During the advanced stages of disk evolution (a few Myr), the gas surface density declines to values comparable to or smaller than that of the minimum mass nebula model and type-I migration is no longer an effective disruption mechanism for mars-mass embryos. Over wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type-I migration efficiency, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has a total mass several times that of the Earth. With this reservoir, there is an adequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rocky planets similar to those around the Sun. But, the onset of efficient gas accretion requires the emergence and retention of cores, more massive than a few M\_earth, prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. The formation probability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor axis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the strength of type-I migration. We suggest that the observed fraction of solar-type stars with gas giant planets can be reproduced only if the actual type-I migration time scale is an order of magnitude longer than that deduced from linear theories.},

In this paper, we modify an existing numerical population synthesis scheme to take into account protoplanetary embryos' interaction with their evolving natal gaseous disk, as well as their close scatterings and resonant interaction with each other. We show that it is possible for a group of compact embryos to emerge interior to the ice line, grow, migrate, and congregate into closely-packed convoys which stall in the proximity of their host stars. After the disk-gas depletion, they undergo orbit crossing, close scattering, and giant impacts to form multiple rocky Earths or super-Earths in non-resonant orbits around {$\sim$} 0.1AU with moderate eccentricities of {$\sim$}0.01-0.1. We suggest that most refractory super-Earths with period in the range of a few days to weeks may have formed through this process.

In this series of papers, we develop and upgrade a population synthesis model as a tool to identify the dominant physical effects and to calibrate the range of physical conditions. Recent planet searches have led to the discovery of many multiple-planet systems. Any theoretical models of their origins must take into account dynamical interactions between emerging protoplanets. Here, we introduce a prescription to approximate the close encounters between multiple planets. We apply this method to simulate the growth, migration, and dynamical interaction of planetary systems. Our models show that in relatively massive disks, several gas giants and rocky/icy planets emerge, migrate, and undergo dynamical instability. Secular perturbation between planets leads to orbital crossings, eccentricity excitation, and planetary ejection. In disks with modest masses, two or less gas giants form with multiple super-Earths. Orbital stability in these systems is generally maintained and they retain the kinematic structure after gas in their natal disks is depleted. These results reproduce the observed planetary mass-eccentricity and semimajor axis-eccentricity correlations. They also suggest that emerging gas giants can scatter residual cores to the outer disk regions. Subsequent in situ gas accretion onto these cores can lead to the formation of distant ({$\greaterequivlnt$} 30 AU) gas giants with nearly circular orbits. \textcopyright{} 2013.

We wish to understand how a significant fraction of the pebbles grows into planetesimals instead of being lost to the host star. Methods. We examined analytically how the inward flow of pebbles is affected by the snow line and under which conditions dust-rich (rocky) planetesimals form. When calculating the inward drift of solids that is due to gas drag, we included the back-reaction of the gas to the motion of the solids. Results. We show that in low-viscosity protoplanetary disks (with a monotonous surface density similar to that of the minimum-mass solar nebula), the flow of pebbles does not usually reach the required surface density to form planetesimals by streaming instability. We show, however, that if the pebble-to-gas-mass flux exceeds a critical value, no steady solution can be found for the solid-to-gas ratio. This is particularly important for low-viscosity disks ({$\alpha$} \textbackslash textless 10-3) where we show that inside of the snow line, silicate-dust grains ejected from sublimating pebbles can accumulate, eventually leading to the formation of dust-rich planetesimals directly by gravitational instability. Conclusions. This formation of dust-rich planetesimals may occur for extended periods of time, while the snow line sweeps from several au to inside of 1 au. The rock-to-ice ratio may thus be globally significantly higher in planetesimals and planets than in the central star.},

While migration sometimes occurs in the supersonic regime, wherein the relative velocity between the planetary embryo and the gas is higher than the sound speed, migration prescriptions proposed thus far describing the planet-disc interaction force and the timescales of orbital change in the supersonic regime are inconsistent with one another. Here we discuss the details of existing prescriptions in the literature and derive a new simple and intuitive formulation for planet-disc interactions based on dynamical friction that can be applied in both supersonic and subsonic cases. While the existing prescriptions assume particular disc models, ours include the explicit dependence on the disc parameters; hence it can be applied to discs with any radial surface density and temperature dependence (except for the local variations with radial scales less than the disc scale height). Our prescription will reduce the uncertainty originating from different literature formulations of planet migration and will be an important tool to study planet accretion processes, especially when studying the formation of close-in low-mass planets that are commonly found in exoplanetary systems.},

  abstract = {Context: The formation of rocky planetesimals is a long-standing problem in planet formation theory. One of the possibilities is that it results from gravitational instability as a result of pile-up of small silicate dust particles released from sublimating icy pebbles that pass the snow line. Aims: We want to understand and quantify the role of the water snow line for the formation of rock-rich and ice-rich planetesimals. In this paper, we focus on the formation of rock-rich planetesimals. A companion paper examines the combined formation of both rock-rich and ice-rich planetesimals. Methods: We develop a new Monte Carlo code to calculate the radial evolution of silicate particles in a turbulent accretion disk, accounting for the back-reaction (i.e., inertia) of the particles on their radial drift velocity and diffusion. Results depend in particular on the particle injection width (determined from the radial sublimation width of icy pebbles), the pebble scale height and the pebble mass flux through the disk. The scale height evolution of the silicate particles, which is the most important factor for the runaway pile-up, is automatically calculated in this Lagrange method. Results: From the numerical results, we derive semi-analytical relations for the scale height of the silicate dust particles and the particles-to-gas density ratio at the midplane, as functions of a pebble-to-gas mass flux ratio and the \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ parameters for disk gas accretion and vertical/radial diffusion.

The conventional critical core mass {$\sim$}5-20 M{$\oplus$} (M{$\oplus$}: Earth's mass), however, is based on some nominal values of these quantities. The discovery of extrasolar giant planets requires investigation of the gas accretion processes under various circumstances. Furthermore, the current planetary accretion theory points out that the cores of Jupiter and Saturn would have been isolated from planetesimals and the core accretion would have almost stopped in their later stage of formation before their masses reached the conventional critical core mass. Through numerical simulations of quasi-static evolution of the gaseous envelope, we have investigated the characteristic growth times of the envelope mass for wide ranges of core accretion rate and grain opacity. We also studied the case where core accretion stops before onset of rapid gas accretion. Our main results are (1) the growth time of the envelope mass {$\tau$}g depends strongly on the core mass, moderately on the grain opacity, and weakly on the past core accretion process, and (2) {$\tau$}g is expressed approximately as {$\tau$}g {$\sim$} 108(Mcore/M{$\oplus$})-2.5(K gr/1 cm2 g-1) yr, where Mcore is the core mass and Kgr is the grain opacity. Our results combined with the recent planetary accretion theory suggest surface density of solid materials twice as massive as that of the minimum-mass solar nebula model and the longer lifetime of the nebula than the 108 yr needed to form Jupiter and Saturn; otherwise migration of protoplanets may have to be considered. Our extensive parametric study not only confirms the difficulty in the formation of the giant planets quantitatively and rigorously, it also gives essential information in considering the problem of the formation, which is quite useful in applications.}

The method is applicable for the range of masses in which velocity changes are dominated by gravitational forces, mutual collisions, and gas drag. Calculations are reported both with and without nebular gas. This method has been compared with N-body simulations, and the results of the two calculations are in agreement. As in earlier calculations, the growth of bodies in this mass range and at 1 AU occurs on a {$\sim$}105 year time scale and is characterized by the evolution of an initially continuous mass distribution into a bimodal distribution, the high mass end of which consists of runaway bodies in the size range of {$\sim$}1026 g. In this general way, these results are in agreement with those reported earlier (e.g., Wetherill and Stewart 1993, Icarus106, 190-209), but significant differences are also found as a result of the greater precision of the collision rate and the velocity evolution rate of planetesimals used in the present work. \textcopyright{} 2001 Academic Press.},

We find that the dust emission peaks at an orbital radius of about 100 AU, while the CO intensity has a central peak coincident with the position of the star. The CO emission is in agreement with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a 2.0M{$\odot$} star, confirming thatMWC758 is indeed an intermediate-mass star. By comparing the observation with theoretical disk models, we derive that the disk surface density {$\sum$}(r) steeply increases from 40 to 100 AU and decreases exponentially outward. Within 40 AU, the disk has to be optically thin in the continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths to explain the observed dust morphology, though our observations lack the angular resolution and sensitivity required to constrain the surface density on these spatial scales. The surface density distribution in MWC 758 disk is similar to that of "transition" disks, though no disk clearing has been previously inferred from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED). Moreover, the asymmetries observed in the dust and CO emission suggest that the disk may be gravitationally perturbed by a low-mass companion orbiting within a radius of 30 AU. Our results emphasize that SEDs alone do not provide a complete picture of disk structure and that high-resolution millimeter-wave images are essential to reveal the structure of the cool disk mid-plane. \textcopyright{} 2010.

High-resolution observations for three additional sources were obtained from the literature. In all cases the disk emission is spatially resolved. We adopt a self-consistent accretion disk model based on the similarity solution for the disk surface density and constrain the dust radial density distribution on spatial scales of about 40 AU. Disk surface densities appear to be correlated with the stellar ages where the characteristic disk radius increases from 20 AU to 100 AU over about 5 Myr. This disk expansion is accompanied by a decrease in the mass accretion rate, suggesting that our sample disks form an evolutionary sequence. Interpreting our results in terms of the temporal evolution of a viscous {$\alpha$}-disk, we estimate (1) that at the beginning of the disk evolution about 60\% of the circumstellar material was located inside radii of 25-40 AU, (2) that disks formed with masses from 0.05 to 0.4 M {$\odot$}, and (3) that the viscous timescale at the disk initial radius is about 0.1-0.3 Myr. Viscous disk models tightly link the surface density {$\Sigma$}(R) with the radial profile of the disk viscosity {$\nu$}(R) R {$\gamma$}. We find values of {$\gamma$} ranging from -0.8 to 0.8, suggesting that the viscosity dependence on the orbital radius can be very different in the observed disks. Adopting the {$\alpha$} parameterization for the viscosity, we argue that {$\alpha$} must decrease with the orbital radius and that it may vary between 0.5 and 10-4. From the inferred disk initial radii we derive specific angular momenta, j, for parent cores of (0.8 - 4) \texttimes{} 10-4 km s-1 pc. Comparison with the values of j in dense cores suggests that about 10\% of core angular momentum and 30\% of the core mass are conserved in the formation of the star/disk system. We demonstrate that the similarity solution for the surface density for {$\gamma$} \textbackslash textless 0 can explain the properties of some "transitional disks" without requiring discontinuities in the disk surface density. In the case of LkCa 15, a smooth distribution of material from few stellar radii to about 240 AU can produce both the observed spectral energy distribution and the spatially resolved continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths. Finally we show that among the observed sample, TW Hya is the only object that has a disk radius comparable with the early solar nebula. \textcopyright{} 2009 The American Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {Abridged: The interest towards searches for extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) was boosted by the discovery of thousands of exoplanets. We turn to the classification of ETCs for new considerations that may help to design better strategies for ETCs searches. We take a basic taxonomic approach to ETCs and investigate the implications of the new classification on ETCs observational patterns. We use as a counter-example to our qualitative classification the quantitative scheme of Kardashev. We propose a classification based on the abilities of ETCs to modify their environment and to integrate with it: Class 0 uses the environment as it is, Class 1 modifies the it to fit its needs, Class 2 modifies itself to fit the environment and Class 3 ETC is fully integrated with the environment. Combined with the classical Kardashev's scale our scheme forms a 2d scheme for interpreting ETC properties. The new framework makes it obvious that the available energy is not an unique measure of ETCs, it may not even correlate with how well that energy is used. The possibility for progress without increased energy consumption implies lower detectability, so the existence of a Kardashev Type III ETC in the Milky Way cannot be ruled out. This reasoning weakens the Fermi paradox, allowing the existence of advanced, yet not energy hungry, low detectability ETCs. The integration of ETCs with environment makes it impossible to tell apart technosignatures from natural phenomena. Thus, the most likely opportunity for SETI searches is to look for beacons, specifically set up by them for young civilizations like us (if they want to do that is a matter of speculation). The other SETI window is to search for ETCs at technological level close to ours. To rephrase the saying of A. Clarke, sufficiently advanced civilizations are indistinguishable from nature.},

In fact, the Solar System is particularly outstanding in its lack of "hot super-Earths" (or "mini-Neptunes"). These planets - or their building blocks - may have formed on wider orbits and migrated inward due to interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Here, we use a suite of dynamical simulations to show that gas giant planets act as barriers to the inward migration of super-Earths initially placed on more distant orbits. Jupiter's early formation may have prevented Uranus and Neptune (and perhaps Saturn's core) from becoming hot super-Earths. Our model predicts that the populations of hot super-Earth systems and Jupiter-like planets should be anti-correlated: gas giants (especially if they form early) should be rare in systems with many hot super-Earths. Testing this prediction will constitute a crucial assessment of the validity of the migration hypothesis for the origin of close-in super-Earths.},

  abstract = {Mass-independent isotopic anomalies of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous meteorites show a clear dichotomy suggesting an efficient separation of the inner and outer solar system. Observations show that ring-like structures in the distribution of mm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks are common. These structures are often associated with drifting pebbles being trapped by local pressure maxima in the gas disk. Similar structures may also have existed in the sun's natal disk, which could naturally explain the meteorite/planetary isotopic dichotomy. Here, we test the effects of a strong pressure bump in the outer disk (e.g. \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$5{$\sim$}au) on the formation of the inner solar system. We model dust coagulation and evolution, planetesimal formation, as well as embryo's growth via planetesimal and pebble accretion. Our results show that terrestrial embryos formed via planetesimal accretion rather than pebble accretion. In our model, the radial drift of pebbles foster planetesimal formation. However, once a pressure bump forms, pebbles in the inner disk are lost via drift before they can be efficiently accreted by embryos growing at \$\textbackslash backslashgtrapprox\$1{$\sim$}au. Embryos inside \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$0.5-1.0au grow relatively faster and can accrete pebbles more efficiently. However, these same embryos grow to larger masses so they should migrate inwards substantially, which is inconsistent with the current solar system. Therefore, terrestrial planets most likely accreted from giant impacts of Moon to roughly Mars-mass planetary embryos formed around \$\textbackslash backslashgtrapprox\$1.0{$\sim$}au. Finally, our simulations produce a steep radial mass distribution of planetesimals in the terrestrial region which is qualitatively aligned with formation models suggesting that the asteroid belt was born low-mass.},

  abstract = {Short-period super-Earth-sized planets are common. Explaining how they form near their present orbits requires understanding the structure of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. Previous studies have argued that the hot inner protoplanetary disc is unstable to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) due to thermal ionization of potassium, and that a local gas pressure maximum forms at the outer edge of this MRI-active zone. Here we present a steady-state model for inner discs accreting viscously, primarily due to the MRI. The structure and MRI-viscosity of the inner disc are fully coupled in our model; moreover, we account for many processes omitted in previous such models, including disc heating by both accretion and stellar irradiation, vertical energy transport, realistic dust opacities, dust effects on disc ionization and non-thermal sources of ionization. For a disc around a solar-mass star with a standard gas accretion rate (\$\textbackslash backslashdot\{M\}\$\$\textbackslash backslashsim\$\$10\^\{-8\}\$M\$\_\textbackslash backslashodot\$yr\$\^\{-1\}\$) and small dust grains, we find that the inner disc is optically thick, and the accretion heat is primarily released near the midplane. As a result, both the disc midplane temperature and the location of the pressure maximum are only marginally affected by stellar irradiation, and the inner disc is also convectively unstable. As previously suggested, the inner disc is primarily ionized through thermionic and potassium ion emission from dust grains, which, at high temperatures, counteract adsorption of free charges onto grains. Our results show that the location of the pressure maximum is determined by the threshold temperature above which thermionic and ion emission become efficient.},

We investigated the evolution of the planet populations using several evaporation models, which are distinguished by the driving force of the escape flow (X-ray or EUV), the heating efficiency in energy-limited evaporation regimes, or both. Although the mass distribution of the planet populations is barely affected by evaporation, the radius distribution clearly shows a break at approximately 2 R {$\oplus$}. We find that evaporation can lead to a bimodal distribution of planetary sizes and to an "evaporation valley" running diagonally downward in the orbital distance - planetary radius plane, separating bare cores from low-mass planets that have kept some primordial H/He. Furthermore, this bimodal distribution is related to the initial characteristics of the planetary populations because low-mass planetary cores can only accrete small primordial H/He envelopes and their envelope masses are proportional to their core masses. We also find that the population-wide effect of evaporation is not sensitive to the heating efficiency of energy-limited description. However, in two extreme cases, namely without evaporation or with a 100\% heating efficiency in an evaporation model, the final size distributions show significant differences; these two scenarios can be ruled out from the size distribution of Kepler candidates.},

We find that the population-wide imprints like the location of the "evaporation valley" in the distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution clearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with the observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in low-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition. Combined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that low-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still undergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets losing all primordial H/He. For planets in this "triangle of evaporation" in the distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced. In the observed diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with increasing radius (R/R\_Earth\textbackslash textless1.6 rocky; 1.6-3.0 ices and/or H/He; \textbackslash textgreater3: H/He). The mass-density diagram contains important information about formation and evolution. Its characteristic broken V-shape reveals the transitions from solid planets to low-mass core-dominated planets with H/He and finally to gas-dominated giants. Evaporation causes density and orbital distance to be anti-correlated for low-mass planets, in contrast to giants, where closer-in planets are less dense, likely due to inflation. The temporal evolution of the statistical properties reported here will be of interest for the PLATO 2.0 mission which will observe the temporal dimension.},

Based on the planet candidates in the Kepler DR25 data release, I first generate a continuous density map of planet distribution using a Gaussian kernel model and correct the geometric factor that the discovery space of a transit event decreases along with the increase of planetary orbital distance. Then I fit two exponential decay functions of detection efficiency along with the increase of planetary orbital distance and the decrease of planetary radius. Finally, the density map of planet distribution is compensated for the fitted exponential decay functions of detection efficiency to obtain a relative occurrence rate distribution of terrestrial planets. The result shows two regions with planet abundance: one corresponds to planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R\_Earth within 0.2 AU, the other corresponds to planets with radii between 1.5 and 3 R\_Earth beyond 0.5 AU. It also confirms the features that may be caused by atmospheric evaporation: there is a vacancy of planets of sizes between 2.0 and 4.0 R\_Earth inside of {$\sim$} 0.5 AU, and a valley with relatively low occurrence rates between 0.2 and 0.5 AU for planets with radii between 1.5 and 3.0 R\_Earth.},

  abstract = {During the initial stages of planet formation in circumstellar gas disks, dust grains collide and build up larger and larger bodies. How this process continues from metre-sized boulders to kilometre-scale planetesimals is a major unsolved problem: boulders are expected to stick together poorly, and to spiral into the protostar in a few hundred orbits owing to a 'headwind' from the slower rotating gas. Gravitational collapse of the solid component has been suggested to overcome this barrier. But even low levels of turbulence will inhibit sedimentation of solids to a sufficiently dense midplane layer, and turbulence must be present to explain observed gas accretion in protostellar disks. Here we report that boulders can undergo efficient gravitational collapse in locally overdense regions in the midplane of the disk. The boulders concentrate initially in transient high pressure regions in the turbulent gas, and these concentrations are augmented a further order of magnitude by a streaming instability driven by the relative flow of gas and solids. We find that gravitationally bound clusters form with masses comparable to dwarf planets and containing a distribution of boulder sizes. Gravitational collapse happens much faster than radial drift, offering a possible path to planetesimal formation in accreting circumstellar disks. \textcopyright 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Chondrules are millimeter-sized spherules that dominate primitive meteorites (chondrites) originating from the asteroid belt. The incorporation of chondrules into asteroidal bodies must be an important step in planet formation, but the mechanism is not understood. We show that the main growth of asteroids can result from gas drag\textendash assisted accretion of chondrules. The largest planetesimals of a population with a characteristic radius of 100 km undergo runaway accretion of chondrules within {$\sim$}3 My, forming planetary embryos up to Mars's size along with smaller asteroids whose size distribution matches that of main belt asteroids. The aerodynamical accretion leads to size sorting of chondrules consistent with chondrites. Accretion of millimeter-sized chondrules and ice particles drives the growth of planetesimals beyond the ice line as well, but the growth time increases above the disc lifetime outside of 25 AU. The contribution of direct planetesimal accretion to the growth of both asteroids and Kuiper belt objects is minor. In contrast, planetesimal accretion and chondrule accretion play more equal roles in the formation of Moon-sized embryos in the terrestrial planet formation region. These embryos are isolated from each other and accrete planetesimals only at a low rate. However, the continued accretion of chondrules destabilizes the oligarchic configuration and leads to the formation of Mars-sized embryos and terrestrial planets by a combination of direct chondrule accretion and giant impacts.},

  abstract = {Planetary migration is a major challenge for planet-formation theories. The speed of type-I migration is proportional to the mass of a protoplanet, while the final decade of growth of a pebble-accreting planetary core takes place at a rate that scales with the mass to the two-thirds power. This results in planetary growth tracks (i.e., the evolution of the mass of a protoplanet versus its distance from the star) that become increasingly horizontal (migration dominated) with the rising mass of the protoplanet. It has been shown recently that the migration torque on a protoplanet is reduced proportional to the relative height of the gas gap carved by the growing planet. Here we show from 1D simulations of planet-disc interaction that the mass at which a planet carves a 50\% gap is approximately 2.3 times the pebble isolation mass. Our measurements of the pebble isolation mass from 1D simulations match published 3D results relatively well, except at very low viscosities ({$\alpha$} \textbackslash textless 10 -3 ) where the 3D pebble isolation mass is significantly higher, possibly due to gap edge instabilities that are not captured in 1D. The pebble isolation mass demarks the transition from pebble accretion to gas accretion. Gas accretion to form gas-giant planets therefore takes place over a few astronomical units of migration after reaching first the pebble isolation mass and, shortly after, the 50\% gap mass. Our results demonstrate how planetary growth can outperform migration both during core accretion and during gas accretion, even when the Stokes number of the pebbles is small, St {$\sim$} 0.01, and the pebble-to-gas flux ratio in the protoplanetary disc is in the nominal range of 0.01-0.02. We find that planetary growth is very rapid in the first million years of the protoplanetary disc and that the probability for forming gas-giant planets increases with the initial size of the protoplanetary disc and with decreasing turbulent diffusion.},

Chondrules inside primitive meteorites - formed by melting of dust aggregate pebbles or in impacts between planetesimals - have similar sizes. The role of pebble accretion for terrestrial planet formation is nevertheless unclear. Here we present a model where inwards-drifting pebbles feed the growth of terrestrial planets. The masses and orbits of Venus, Earth, Theia (which later collided with the Earth to form the Moon) and Mars are all consistent with pebble accretion onto protoplanets that formed around Mars' orbit and migrated to their final positions while growing. The isotopic compositions of Earth and Mars are matched qualitatively by accretion of two generations of pebbles, carrying distinct isotopic signatures. Finally, we show that the water and carbon budget of Earth can be delivered by pebbles from the early generation before the gas envelope became hot enough to vaporise volatiles.},

Here, we report the calculation of revised radii and densities for 320 non-Kepler exoplanets using this data and present updated calculations of the incident ux received by 690 known exoplanets. This allows the likelihood that those planets orbit in the habitable zone of their host stars to be reassessed. As a result of this analysis, three planets can be added to the catalogue of potentially habitable worlds: HIP 67537 b, HD 148156 b, and HD 106720 b. In addition, the changed parameterisation of BD +49 898 means that its planet, BD +49 898 b, now receives an incident ux that places it outside the optimistic habitable zone region, as defined by (Kopparapu et al. 2013, 2014). We find that use of the new Gaia data results in a mean increase in calculated exoplanet radius of 3.76\%. Previously, CoRoT-3 b had been reported as having the highest density of all known exoplanets. Here, we use updated information to revise the calculated density of CoRoT-3 b from 26.4gcm-3 to 16.1-3:98gcm-3. We also report the densest exoplanet in our dataset, KELT-1 b, with a density of 22.1+5:62-9:16g cm-3. Overall, our results highlight the importance of ensuring the the parameterisation of known exoplanets be revisited whenever significant improvements are made to the precision of the stellar parameters upon which they are based.},

We analyze a sample of 1194 stars drawn from the California Planet Survey targets to determine the empirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giant planet as a function of its mass and metallicity. Our stellar sample ranges from M dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 Msun to intermediate-mass subgiants with masses as high as 1.9 Msun. In agreement with previous studies, our sample exhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fraction of stars that harbor giant planets scales as f \$\textbackslash backslash\$propto 10\^\{1.2 [Fe/H]\}. We can rule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98\% confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets are not likely due to convective envelope "pollution." Our data also rule out a constant planet occurrence rate for [Fe/H]\textbackslash textless 0, indicating that giant planets continue to become rarer at sub-Solar metallicities. We also find that planet occurrence increases with stellar mass (f \$\textbackslash backslash\$propto Mstar), characterized by a rise from 3.5\% around M dwarfs (0.5 Msun) to 14\% around A stars (2 Msun), at Solar metallicity. We argue that the correlation between stellar properties and giant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretion model of planet formation.},

The gap width is proportional to the square root of the planet mass, 3/4 the power of the disk aspect ratio and 1/4 the power of the viscosity. This empirical formula enables us to estimate the mass of a planet embedded in the disk from the width of an observed gap. We have applied the empirical formula for the gap width to the disk around HL Tau, assuming that each gap observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations is produced by planets, and discussed the planet masses within the gaps. The estimate of planet masses from the gap widths is less affected by the observational resolution and dust filtration than that by the gap depth.},

As a consequence, the density of the dust grains can increase up to the same level of the density of the gas at the outer edge. The feedback on the gas from the drifting dust grains is not negligible, in such a dusty region. We carried out two-dimensional two-fluid (gas and dust) hydrodynamic simulations. We found that when the radial flow of the dust grains across the gap is halted, a broad ring of the dust grains can be formed because of the dust feedback and the diffusion of the dust grains. The minimum mass of the planet to form the broad dust ring is consistent with the pebble-isolation mass, in the parameter range of our simulations. The broad ring of the dust grains is good environment for the formation of the protoplanetary solid core. If the ring is formed in the disk around the sun-like star at {$\sim$} 2 AU, a massive solid core ({$\sim$} 50M) can be formed within the ring, which may be connected to the formation of Hot Jupiters holding a massive solid core such as HD 149026b. In the disk of the dwarf star, a number of Earth-sized planets can be formed within the dust ring around {$\sim$} 0.5 AU, which potentially explain the planet system made of multiple Earth-sized planets around the dwarf star such as TRAPPIST-1.},

It is expected that in the ideal case, a gap-opening planet migrates at the viscous drift speed, which is referred to as type II migration. However, recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that in general, the gap-opening planet is not locked to the viscous disk evolution. A new physical model is required to explain the migration speed of such a planet. For this reason, we re-examined the migration of a planet in the disk, by carrying out the two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a wide parameter range. We have found that the torque exerted on the gap-opening planet depends on the surface density at the bottom of the gap. The planet migration slows down as the surface density of the bottom of the gap decreases. Using the gap model developed in our previous studies, we have constructed an empirical formula of the migration speed of the gap-opening planets, which is consistent with the results given by the hydrodynamic simulations performed by us and other researchers. Our model easily explains why the migration speed of the gap-opening planets can be faster than the viscous gas drift speed. It can also predict the planet mass at which the type I migration is no longer adequate due to the gap development in the disk, providing a gap formation criterion based on planetary migration.},

Here we provide analytical expressions for these probabilities, investigate their properties, and calculate their values for the known extrasolar planets. We furthermore quantitatively discuss constraints on existence and observability of primary transits if a secondary eclipse is observed. Finally, we calculate the a posteriori transit probabilities of the known extrasolar planets, and we present several case studies in which orbital constraints resulting from the presence of a secondary eclipse may be applied in observing campaigns.},

  abstract = {Over the past several decades, thousands of planets have been discovered outside of our Solar System. These planets exhibit enormous diversity, and their large numbers provide a statistical opportunity to place our Solar System within the broader context of planetary structure, atmospheres, architectures, formation, and evolution. Meanwhile, the field of exoplanetary science is rapidly forging onward towards a goal of atmospheric characterization, inferring surface conditions and interiors, and assessing the potential for habitability. However, the interpretation of exoplanet data requires the development and validation of exoplanet models that depend on in-situ data that, in the foreseeable future, are only obtainable from our Solar System. Thus, planetary and exoplanetary science would both greatly benefit from a symbiotic relationship with a two-way flow of information. Here, we describe the critical lessons and outstanding questions from planetary science, the study of which are essential for addressing fundamental aspects for a variety of exoplanetary topics. We outline these lessons and questions for the major categories of Solar System bodies, including the terrestrial planets, the giant planets, moons, and minor bodies. We provide a discussion of how many of these planetary science issues may be translated into exoplanet observables that will yield critical insight into current and future exoplanet discoveries.},

  abstract = {Exoplanet discoveries have reached into the realm of terrestrial planets that are becoming the subject of atmospheric studies. One such discovery is LHS 3844b, a 1.3 Earth radius planet in a 0.46 day orbit around an M4.5-5 dwarf star. Follow-up observations indicate that the planet is largely devoid of substantial atmosphere. This lack of significant atmosphere places astrophysical and geophysical constraints on LHS 3844b, primarily the degree of volatile outgassing and the rate of atmosphere erosion. We estimate the age of the host star as \$7.8\textbackslash backslashpm1.6\$ Gyrs and find evidence of an active past comparable to Proxima Centauri. We use geodynamical models of volcanic outgassing and atmospheric erosion to show that the apparent lack of atmosphere is consistent with a volatile-poor mantle for LHS 3844b. We show the core is unlikely to host enough C to produce a sufficiently volatile-poor mantle, unless the bulk planet is volatile-poor relative to Earth. While we cannot rule out a giant impact stripping LHS 3844b's atmosphere, we show this mechanism would require significant mantle stripping, potentially leaving LHS 3844b as an Fe-rich "super-Mercury". Atmospheric erosion by smaller impacts is possible, but only if the planet has already begun degassing and is bombarded by \$10\^3\$ impactors of radius 500-1000 km traveling at escape velocity. We discuss formation and migration scenarios that could account for a volatile poor origin, including the potential for an unobserved massive companion planet. A relatively volatile-poor composition of LHS 3844b suggests that the planet formed interior to the system snow-line.},

  abstract = {M dwarfs, though the most abundant star in the galaxy, form only a small subset of stellar hosts with exoplanets with measured radii and masses. In this paper we analyze the Mass-Radius (M-R) relationship of planets around M dwarfs using M-R measurements for 24 exoplanets. In particular, we apply both parametric and nonparametric models and compare the two different fitting methods. We also use these methods to compare the results of the M dwarf M-R relationship with that from the Kepler sample. Using the nonparametric method, we find that the predicted masses for the smallest and largest planets around M dwarfs are smaller than that given by the relation fit to the Kepler data, but that the distribution of masses for 3 Earth Radii planets does not substantially differ between the two datasets. With future additions to the M dwarf M-R relation from TESS and instruments like the Habitable Zone Planet Finder, we will be able to characterize these differences in more detail, which will help illuminate the process of planetary formation and evolution around these stars. We release a publicly available Python code called MRExo which uses the nonparametric algorithm introduced by Ning et al. (2018) to fit the M-R relationship. Such a nonparametric fit does not assume an underlying power law fit to the measurements and hence can be used on samples spanning large mass and radii ranges. Therefore by not assuming a functional form, the fit is less biased. MRExo also offers a tool to predict mass from radius posteriors, and vice versa. This functionality can help inform observational strategies for radial velocity campaigns, such as TESS follow-up studies, as well as predict radii with microlensing planet masses.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: \textbullet{} From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. \textbullet{} Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. \textbullet{} Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. \textbullet{} In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. \textbullet{} The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. \textbullet{} When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. \textbullet{} Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. \textbullet{} It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used. \textcopyright{} 1995 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Of the over 800 exoplanets detected to date, over half are on non-circular orbits, with eccentricities as high as 0.93. Such orbits lead to time-variable stellar heating, which has major implications for the planet's atmospheric dynamical regime. However, little is known about the fundamental dynamical regime of such planetary atmospheres, and how it may influence the observations of these planets. Therefore, we present a systematic study of hot Jupiters on highly eccentric orbits using the SPARC/MITgcm, a model which couples a three-dimensional general circulation model (the MITgcm) with a plane-parallel, two-stream, non-gray radiative transfer model. In our study, we vary the eccentricity and orbit-average stellar flux over a wide range. We demonstrate that the eccentric hot Jupiter regime is qualitatively similar to that of planets on circular orbits; the planets possess a superrotating equatorial jet and exhibit large day-night temperature variations. As in Showman \& Polvani, we show that the day-night heating variations induce momentum fluxes equatorward to maintain the superrotating jet throughout its orbit. We find that as the eccentricity and/or stellar flux is increased (corresponding to shorter orbital periods), the superrotating jet strengthens and narrows, due to a smaller Rossby deformation radius. For a select number of model integrations, we generate full-orbit light curves and find that the timing of transit and secondary eclipse viewed from Earth with respect to periapse and apoapse can greatly affect what we see in infrared (IR) light curves; the peak in IR flux can lead or lag secondary eclipse depending on the geometry. For those planets that have large temperature differences from dayside to nightside and rapid rotation rates, we find that the light curves can exhibit "ringing" as the planet's hottest region rotates in and out of view from Earth. These results can be used to explain future observations of eccentric transiting exoplanets. \textcopyright{} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

Our catalog is based on all known such candidates in the literature as well as new candidates from the search in this paper, and provides a resource to explore the planet population near the snow line of Sun-like stars. We homogeneously performed pixel-level vetting, stellar characterization with Gaia parallax and archival/Subaru spectroscopy, and light-curve modeling to derive planet parameters and to eliminate stellar binaries. The resulting clean sample consists of 67 planet candidates whose radii are typically constrained to 5\%, in which 23 are newly reported. The number of Jupiter-sized candidates (29 with r \textbackslash textgreater 8 R{$\bigoplus$}) in the sample is consistent with the Doppler occurrence. The smaller candidates are more prevalent (23 with 4 \textbackslash textless r/R{$\bigoplus$} \textbackslash textless 8, 15 with r/R{$\bigoplus$} \textbackslash textless 4) and suggest that long-period Neptune-sized planets are at least as common as the Jupiter-sized ones, although our sample is yet to be corrected for detection completeness.

However, time is of the essence to take full advantage of this opportunity. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), although delayed, will still complete its nominal five year mission on a timeline that motivates rapid identification, confirmation, and mass measurement of the top atmospheric characterization targets from TESS. Beyond JWST, future dedicated missions for atmospheric studies such as the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) require the discovery and confirmation of several hundred additional sub-Jovian size planets (Rp\textbackslash textless10 R{$\oplus$}) orbiting bright stars, beyond those known today, to ensure a successful statistical census of exoplanet atmospheres. Groundbased extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will also contribute to surveying the atmospheres of the transiting planets discovered by TESS. Here we present a set of two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying the expected signal-tonoise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given planet, that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be readily identified among the TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our proposed threshold values for these metrics would be encouraged for rapid follow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements. Based on the catalog of simulated TESS detections by Sullivan et al., we determine appropriate cutoff values of the metrics, such that the TESS mission will ultimately yield a sample of {$\sim$}300 high-quality atmospheric characterization targets across a range of planet size bins, extending down to Earth-size, potentially habitable worlds.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Context. Young circumstellar disks are the birthplaces of planets. Their study is of prime interest to understand the physical and chemical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Only very few detections of planet candidates within these disks exist, and most of them are currently suspected to be disk features. Aims. In this context, the transition disk around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap identified in previous observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We aim to search for the presence of an embedded young planet and search for disk structures that may be the result of disk-planet interactions and other evolutionary processes. Methods. We analyse new and archival near-infrared images of the transition disk PDS 70 obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo, and Gemini/NICI instruments in polarimetric differential imaging and angular differential imaging modes. Results. We detect a point source within the gap of the disk at about 195 mas ({$\sim$}22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at five different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The astrometry results in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The comparison of the measured magnitudes and colours to evolutionary tracks suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass. The luminosity of the detected object is consistent with that of an L-type dwarf, but its IR colours are redder, possibly indicating the presence of warm surrounding material. Further, we confirm the detection of a large gap of {$\sim$}54 au in size within the disk in our scattered light images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We find that its spatial extent is very likely smaller than {$\sim$}17 au in radius, and its position angle is consistent with that of the outer disk. The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal brightness distribution which is different at different wavelengths and may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very small grains. Conclusions. The detection of a young protoplanet within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70 opens the door to a so far observationally unexplored parameter space of planetary formation and evolution. Future observations of this system at different wavelengths and continuing astrometry will allow us to test theoretical predictions regarding planet-disk interactions, planetary atmospheres, and evolutionary models.},

  abstract = {Context. Imaged in the gap of a transition disk and found at a separation of about 195 mas ({$\sim$}22 au) from its host star at a position angle of about 155\textdegree, PDS 70 b is the most robustly detected young planet to date. This system is therefore a unique laboratory for characterizing the properties of young planetary systems at the stage of their formation. Aims. We aim to trace direct and indirect imprints of PDS 70 b on the gas and dust emission of the circumstellar disk in order to study the properties of this {$\sim$}5 Myr young planetary system. Methods. We obtained ALMA band 7 observations of PDS 70 in dust continuum and 12CO(3-2) and combined them with archival data. This resulted in an unprecedented angular resolution of about 70mas ({$\sim$}8 au). Results. We derive an upper limit on circumplanetary material at the location of PDS 70 b of {$\sim$}0.01 M{$\oplus$} and find a highly structured circumstellar disk in both dust and gas. The outer dust ring peaks at 0.6500(74 au) and reveals a possible second unresolved peak at about 0.5300(60 au). The integrated intensity of CO also shows evidence of a depletion of emission at {$\sim$}0.200(23 au) with a width of {$\sim$}0.100(11 au). The gas kinematics show evidence of a deviation from Keplerian rotation inside .0.800(91 au). This implies a pressure gradient that can account for the location of the dust ring well beyond the location of PDS 70 b. Farther in, we detect an inner disk that appears to be connected to the outer disk by a possible bridge feature in the northwest region in both gas and dust. We compare the observations to hydrodynamical simulations that include a planet with different masses that cover the estimated mass range that was previously derived from near-infrared photometry ({$\sim$}5-9 MJup). We find that even a planet with a mass of 10MJup may not be sufficient to explain the extent of the wide gap, and an additional low-mass companion may be needed to account for the observed disk morphology.},

  abstract = {A large fraction of stars is found to be part of binary or higher-order multiple systems. The ubiquity of planets found around single stars raises the question if and how planets in binary systems may form. Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and their characterization is crucial in order to understand the planet formation process. Our aim is to characterize the morphology of the GG Tau A disk, one of the largest and most massive circumbinary disks, and trace evidence for binary-disk interactions. We obtained observations in polarized scattered light of GG Tau A using the SPHERE/IRDIS instrument in the H-band filter. We analyze the observed disk morphology and substructures. We run 2D hydrodynamical models simulating the evolution of the circumbinary ring over the lifetime of the disk. The disk, as well as the cavity and the inner region are highly structured with several shadowed regions, spiral structures, and streamer-like filaments, some of them detected for the first time. The streamer-like filaments appear to connect the outer ring with the northern arc. Their azimuthal spacing suggests that they may be generated by periodic perturbations by the binary, tearing off material from the inner edge of the outer disk once during each orbit. By comparing observations to hydrodynamical simulations we find that the main features, in particular the gap size, as well as the spiral and streamer filaments, can be qualitatively explained by the gravitational interactions of a binary with semi-major axis of \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$35 au on an orbit coplanar with the circumbinary ring.},

Recently, an asymmetric signature of iron absorption has been resolved in the transmission spectrum of WASP-76b using ESPRESSO on ESO's Very large Telescope. This feature is interpreted as being due to condensation of iron on the nightside, resulting in a different absorption signature from the evening than from the morning limb of the planet. It represents the first time that a chemical gradient has been observed across the surface of a single exoplanet. In this work, we confirm the presence of the asymmetric iron feature using archival HARPS data of four transits. The detection shows that such features can also be resolved by observing multiple transits on smaller telescopes. By increasing the number of planets where these condensation features are detected, we can make chemical comparisons between exoplanets and map condensation across a range of parameters for the first time.},

We investigate how this high-energy irradiation varies with time by combining an empirical relation describing stellar X-ray emission with a second relation describing the ratio of solar X-ray to EUV emission. In contrast to assumptions commonly made when modelling atmospheric escape, we find that the decline in stellar EUV emission is much slower than in X-rays, and that the total EUV irradiation of planetary atmospheres is dominated by emission after the saturated phase of high-energy emission (which lasts around 100 Myr after the formation of the star). The EUV spectrum also becomes much softer during this slow decline. Furthermore, we find that the total combined X-ray and EUV emission of stars occurs mostly after the saturated phase. Our results suggest that models of atmospheric escape that focus on the saturated phase of high-energy emission are oversimplified, and when considering the evolution of planetary atmospheres it is necessary to follow EUV-driven escape on Gyr time-scales. This may make it more difficult to use stellar age to separate the effects of photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss when considering the origin of the planet radius valley.},

These effects are particularly crucial in light of the long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by for example CoRoT and the Kepler Mission (8.5 and 30 minutes). One of the dominant effects of long integration times is a systematic underestimation of the lightcurve derived stellar density, which has significant ramifications for transit surveys. We present a discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such techniques, as a function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence lightcurves.},

  abstract = {The search for extrasolar planets is strongly motivated by the goal of characterizing how frequent habitable worlds and life may be within the Galaxy. Whilst much effort has been spent on searching for Earth-like planets, large moons may also be common, temperate abodes for life as well. The methods to detect extrasolar moons, or "exomoons" are more subtle than their planetary counterparts and in this thesis I aim to provide a method to find such bodies in transiting systems, which offer the greatest potential for detection. Before one can search for the tiny perturbations to the planetary signal, an understanding of the planetary transit must be established. Therefore, in Chapters 3 to 5 I discuss the transit model and provide several new insights. Chapter 4 presents new analytic expressions for the times of transit minima and the transit duration, which will be critical in the later search for exomoons. Chapter 5 discusses two sources of distortion to the transit signal, namely blending (with a focus on the previously unconsidered self-blending scenario) and light curve smearing due to long integration times. I provide methods to compensate for both of these effects, thus permitting for the accurate modelling of the planetary transit light curve. In Chapter 6, I discuss methods to detect exomoons through their gravitational influence on the host planet, giving rise to transit timing and duration variations (TTV and TDV). The previously known TTV effect is updated with a new model and the associated critical problems are outlined. I then predict a new effect, TDV, which solves these problems, making exomoon detection viable. Chapter 7 presents a feasibility study for detecting habitable-zone exomoons with Kepler, where it is found that moons down to 0.2 Earth masses are detectable. Finally, conclusions and future work are discussed in Chapter 8.},

Kepler has revealed a rich diversity of outcomes, from perfectly ordered systems, like Kepler-80, to ostensibly disordered systems, like Kepler-20. Under the hypothesis that systems are born via preferred formation pathways, one might reasonably expect non-random size-orderings reflecting these processes. However, subsequent dynamical evolution, often chaotic and turbulent in nature, may erode this information and so here we ask - do systems remember how they formed? To address this, we devise a model to define the entropy of a planetary system's size-ordering, by first comparing differences between neighbouring planets and then extending to accommodate differences across the chain.We derive closed-form solutions for many of the microstate occupancies and provide public code with look-up tables to compute entropy for up to 10-planet systems. All three proposed entropy definitions exhibit the expected property that their credible interval increases with respect to a proxy for time. We find that the observed Kepler multis display a highly significant deficit in entropy compared to a randomly generated population. Incorporating a filter for systems deemed likely to be dynamically packed, we show that this result is robust against the possibility of missing planets too. Put together, our work establishes that Kepler systems do indeed remember something of their younger years and highlights the value of information theory for exoplanetary science.},

  abstract = {Life emerged on the Earth within the first quintile of its habitable window, but a technological civilization did not blossom until its last. Efforts to infer the rate of abiogenesis, based on its early emergence, are frustrated by the selection effect that if the evolution of intelligence is a slow process, then life's early start may simply be a prerequisite to our existence, rather than useful evidence for optimism. In this work, we interpret the chronology of these two events in a Bayesian framework, extending upon previous work by considering that the evolutionary timescale is itself an unknown that needs to be jointly inferred, rather than fiducially set. We further adopt an objective Bayesian approach, such that our results would be agreed upon even by those using wildly different priors for the rates of abiogenesis and evolution - common points of contention for this problem. It is then shown that the earliest microfossil evidence for life indicates that the rate of abiogenesis is at least 2.8 times more likely to be a typically rapid process, rather than a slow one. This modest limiting Bayes factor rises to 8.7 if we accept the more disputed evidence of C13 depleted zircon deposits (Bell et al. 2015). For intelligence evolution, it is found that a rare-intelligence scenario is slightly favored at 3:2 betting odds. Thus, if we re-ran Earth's clock, one should statistically favor life to frequently re-emerge, but intelligence may not be as inevitable.},

  abstract = {Exomoons are predicted to produce transit timing variations (TTVs) upon their host planet. Unfortunately, so are many other astrophysical phenomena - most notably other planets in the system. In this work, an argument of reductio ad absurdum is invoked, by deriving the transit timing effects that are impossible for a single exomoon to produce. Our work derives three key analytic tests. First, one may exploit the fact that a TTV signal from an exomoon should be accompanied by transit duration variations (TDVs), and that one can derive a TDV floor as a minimum expected level of variability. Cases for which the TDV upper limit is below this floor can thus be killed as exomoon candidates. Second, formulae are provided for estimating whether moons are expected to be 'killable' when no TDVs presently exist, thus enabling the community to estimate whether it's even worth deriving TDVs in the first place. Third, a TTV ceiling is derived, above which exomoons should never be able to produce TTV amplitudes. These tools are applied to a catalog of TTVs and TDVs for two and half thousand Kepler Objects Interest, revealing over two hundred cases that cannot be due to a moon. These tests are also applied to the exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b i, which comfortably passes the criteria. These simple analytic results should provide a means of rapidly rejecting putative exomoons and streamlining the search for satellites.},

Here, we perform an independent investigation, which is framed in terms of three questions: 1) Are there significant excess TTVs? 2) Is there a significant periodic TTV? 3) Is there evidence for a non-zero moon mass? We applied rigorous statistical methods to these questions alongside a re-analysis of the Kepler photometry and find that none of the KOIs satisfy these three tests. Specifically, KOIs-268.01 \& 3220.01 pass none of the tests and KOIs-303.01, 1888.01 \& 1925.01 pass a single test each. Only KOI-2728.01 satisfies two, but fails the cross-validation test for predictions. Further, detailed photodynamical modeling reveals that KOI-2728.01 favours a negative radius moon (as does KOI-268.01). We also note that we find a significant photoeccentric for KOI-1925.01 indicating an eccentric orbit of e\textbackslash textgreater(0.62+/-0.06). For comparison, we applied the same tests to Kepler-1625b, which reveals that 1) and 3) are passed, but 2) cannot be checked with the cross-validation method used here, due to the limited number of available epochs. In conclusion, we find no compelling evidence for exomoons amongst the six KOIs. Despite this, we're able to derive exomoon mass upper limits versus semi-major axis, with KOI-3220.01 leading to particularly impressive constraints of Ms/Mp \textbackslash textless 0.4\% [2 sigma] at a similar relative semi-major to that of the Earth-Moon.},

Unfortunately, distinguishing moon-induced TTVs from other sources, in particular planet\textendash planet interactions, has severely impeded its usefulness as a tool for identifying exomoon candidates. A key feature of exomoon TTVs is that they will always be undersampled, due to the simple fact that we can only observe the TTVs once per transit/planetary period. We show that it is possible to analytically express the aliased TTV periodicity as a function of planet and moon period. Further, we show that inverting an aliased TTV period back to a true moon period is fraught with hundreds of harmonic modes. However, a unique aspect of these TTV aliases is that they are predicted to occur at consistently short periods, irrespective of what model one assumes for the underlying moon population. Specifically, 50 per cent of all exomoons are expected to induce TTVs with a period between 2 to 4 cycles, a range that planet\textendash planet interactions rarely manifest at. This provides an exciting and simple tool for quickly identifying exomoons candidates and brings the TTV method back to the fore as an exomoon hunting strategy. Applying this method to the candidate, Kepler-1625b i, reveals that its TTV periodicity centres around the median period expected for exomoons.},

We identify a pathway by which 1-1.7 \$R\_\{Earth\}\$ (1-10 \$M\_\{Earth\}\$) rocky exoplanets with orbital periods of 10-100 days can acquire long-lived 10-2000 bar atmospheres that are H\$\_2\$O-dominated, with mean molecular weight \$\textbackslash textgreater\$10. These atmospheres form during the planets' evolution from sub-Neptunes into rocky exoplanets. H\$\_2\$O that is made by reduction of iron oxides in the silicate magma is highly soluble in the magma, forming a dissolved reservoir that is protected from loss so long as the H\$\_2\$-dominated atmosphere persists. The large size of the dissolved reservoir buffers the H\$\_2\$O atmosphere against loss after the H\$\_2\$ has dispersed. Within our model, a long-lived, water-dominated atmosphere is a common outcome for efficient interaction between a nebula-derived atmosphere (peak atmosphere mass fraction 0.1-0.6 wt\%) and oxidized magma (\$\textbackslash textgreater\$5 wt\% FeO), followed by atmospheric loss. This idea predicts that most rocky planets that have orbital periods of 10-100 days and that have radii within 0.1-0.2 \$R\_\{Earth\}\$ of the lower edge of the radius valley still retain H\$\_2\$O atmospheres. This prediction is imminently testable with JWST and has implications for the interpretation of data for transiting super-Earths.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new mechanism for number density enhancement and size segregation of particles in a nonlaminar accretion disk, e.g., the solar nebula. It can be shown that, if there is a vortical flow with a rotational frequency smaller than the local orbital frequency of the disk and a rotational axis parallel to the midplane of the nebula, particles will be trapped and concentrated in the gas flow. Due to the centrifugal force, a particle can be driven out of an eddy. It will be shown that this process is inhibited by the gravitational force induced by the protostar. Candidates for such slowly circulating flows are turbulent flow features in a size range close to the integral size of the turbulence as well as huge convection cells. The efficiency of the particle concentration depends on the coupling of the particle to the gas, i.e., the friction time. On account of the mass dependence of the friction time, a given eddy becomes a trap for particles of a characteristic size and causes a local change in the dust density. We calculate the maximal dust inhomogeneity due to this process. The strongest effect was observed for millimeter-sized particles, which can be concentrated by a factor of 100 within only 100 years. Our general estimates do not depend on special turbulence or convection models. In addition, we compare the analytical estimates with the results of numerical simulations of the dust motion. The effect will have an impact on the dust coagulation process and may be a link to the size distribution of chondrules. \textcopyright{} 1997 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {We study the formation of a giant gas planet by the core accretion and gas capture process, with numerical simulations, under the assumption that the planetary core forms in the center of an anticyclonic vortex. The presence of the vortex concentrates centimeter- to meter-sized particles from the surrounding disk and speeds up the core formation process. Assuming that a planet of Jupiter mass is forming at 5 AU from the star, the vortex enhancement results in considerably shorter formation times than are found in standard core-accretion gas-capture simulations. Also, formation of a gas giant is possible in a disk with mass comparable to that of the minimum mass solar nebula.},

But what process sets the physical scales on which this collapse may occur? Star formation has the Jeans mass, that is when gravity is stronger than thermal pressure, helping us to understand the mass of our sun. But what controls mass and size in the case of planetesimal formation? Both asteroids and Kuiper belt objects show a kink in their size distribution at 100 km. Here we derive a gravitational collapse criterion for a pebble cloud to fragment to planetesimals, showing that a critical mass is needed for the clump to overcome turbulent diffusion. We successfully tested the validity of this criterion in direct numerical simulations of planetesimal formation triggered by the streaming instability. Our result can therefore explain the sizes for planetesimals found forming in streaming instability simulations in the literature, while not addressing the detailed size distribution. We find that the observed characteristic diameters of {$\sim$} 100 km corresponds to the critical mass of a pebble cloud set by the strength of turbulent diffusion stemming from streaming instability for a wide region of a solar nebula model from 2 - 60 au, with a tendency to allow for smaller objects at distances beyond and at late times, when the nebula gas gets depleted.},

  abstract = {We perform streaming instability simulations at Hill density and beyond, to demonstrate that Planetesimal formation is not completed when pebble accumulations exceed the local Hill density. We find that Hill density is not a sufficient criterion for further gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud into a planetesimal, but that additionally the accumulated mass has to be large enough to overcome turbulent diffusion. A Toomre analysis of the system indicates that linear self-gravity modes play no role on the scale of our numerical simulation. We nevertheless find that self-gravity, by vertically contracting the pebble layer, increases the strength of turbulence, which is either an indication of Kelvin Helmholtz Instability or a boost of the streaming-instability. We furthermore determine the Bonnor-Ebert central density to which a pebble cloud of given mass has to be compressed before it would be able to continue contraction against internal diffusion. As the equivalent "solid body" size of the pebble cloud scales with the central density to the power of -1/6, it is much easier to have a pebble cloud of 100 km equivalent size to collapse than one of 10 km for the same level of turbulent diffusion. This can explain the lack of small bodies in the solar system and predicts to have small objects formed by gravitational collapse at large pebble to gas ratios, in the outskirts of the solar nebula and at late times of generally reduced gas mass.},

The disk is treated as a two-dimensional viscous fluid and the planet is kept on a fixed orbit. We run a set of simulations varying the planet mass, and the viscosity and temperature of the disk. All runs are followed until they reach a quasi-equilibrium state. Results. We find that for planetary masses above a certain minimum mass, already 3 M Jup for a viscosity of {$\nu$} = 10 -5 , the disk makes a transition from a nearly circular state into an eccentric state. Increasing the planetary mass leads to a saturation of disk eccentricity with a maximum value of around 0.25. The transition to the eccentric state is driven by the excitation of an m = 2 spiral wave at the outer 1:3 Lindblad resonance. The effect occurs only if the planetary mass is large enough to clear a sufficiently wide and deep gap to reduce the damping effect of the outer 1:2 Lindblad resonance. An increase in viscosity or temperature in the disk, which both tend to close the gap, have an adverse influence on the disk eccentricity. Conclusions. In the eccentric state the mass accretion rate onto the planet is greatly enhanced, an effect that may ease the formation of massive planets beyond about 5 M Jup that are otherwise difficult to reach.},

The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom pipeline to correct CMOS detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was used to simultaneously detrend the photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model. ASTERIA made a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e (\$\textbackslash backslashsim2\${$\sim\$\backslash$}backslash\$Rearth), measuring a transit depth of \$374\textbackslash backslashpm170\$ ppm.

  abstract = {Orbital evolution of protoplanets embedded in a swarm of planetesimals has been investigated to study the late state of planetary formation when protoplanets suffer perturbations among themselves and dynamical friction by surrounding planetesimals. We investigated the orbital evolution through direct three-dimensional N-body simulations. We found that the orbital separation between two protoplanets on circular orbits cannot be smaller than about 5 rH, where rH is the Hill radius of the two protoplanets. If it is smaller than about 5 rH, two protoplanets approach closely and experience close encounters. This protoplanet-protoplanet scattering increases their eccentricities and expands their orbital separation. Dynamical friction by planetesimals does not work effectively during such an impulsive scattering. After the scattering, dynamical friction damps the gained eccentricities gradually and makes their orbits nearly circular again, keeping the expanded orbital separation. This repulsion of two nearly circular orbits continues until their separation becomes larger than about 5 rH, when the protoplanet-protoplanet scattering is no longer effective. As protoplanets grow, their orbital separation measured by the Hill radius becomes small since rH varies as M1/3, where M is the mass of the protoplanet. They repeat the repulsion while growing. In conclusion, two protoplanets grow keeping their orbits nearly circular and their orbit separation larger than about 5 rH without orbit crossing. Based on these results, we describe a scenario for the late state of planetary formation.},

The growth mode of planetesimals is investigated with 3000 equal-mass planetesimals under perfect and gas-free accretion. We present conclusive evidence of runaway growth, which was first found through the statistical studies of the coagulation equation with the particle-in-a-box kinetic theory (e.g., Wetherill, G. W., and G. R. Stewart 1989. Icarus 77, 330-367). The statistical approach is based on the averaged quantities and thus would not be suitable for describing runaway growth. Our approach can describe runaway growth naturally. The number of bodies in our simulations is large enough to derive the statistical properties of the system. We find that the mass distribution immediately relaxes into the continuous power-law mass distribution with dNc/dm {$\propto$} m-2.5{$\pm$}0.4, where Nc is the cumulative number of bodies. Then the largest body of the continuous mass distribution becomes detached from the continuous mass distribution and shows runaway growth in mass. The velocity dispersion (eccentricity and inclination) is almost inversely proportional to the square-root of mass except for the top and tail parts of the mass distribution. These results agree with the results by the statistical kinetic theory approach. \textcopyright{} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

The orbits of planetesimals evolve through two-body gravitational relaxation: viscous stirring increases the random velocity and dynamical friction realizes the equiparation of the random energy.

Here we present a three-dimensional model that explains this relationship, in order to shed insight on the processes that control heat redistribution in tidally-locked planetary atmospheres. This three-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric circulation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of equilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag strengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic theory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves mediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres, analogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure in Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by either radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag would likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere threaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with increasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and cooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative heating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing equilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in controlling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our analytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important if it is stronger than the Coriolis force. As a result, dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres increase with increasing stellar irradiation and decrease with increasing pressure.},

  abstract = {The recent detections of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting nearby stars and the promise of characterizing their atmospheres motivates a need to understand how the diversity of possible planetary parameters affects the climate of terrestrial planets. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric circulation and climate of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting both Sun-like and M-dwarf stars over a wide swath of possible planetary parameters, including the planetary rotation period, surface pressure, incident stellar flux, surface gravity, planetary radius, and cloud particle size. We do so using a general circulation model (GCM) that includes non-grey radiative transfer and the effects of clouds. The results from this suite of simulations generally show qualitatively similar dependencies of circulation and climate on planetary parameters as idealized GCMs, with quantitative differences due to the inclusion of additional model physics. Notably, we find that the effective cloud particle size is a key unknown parameter that can greatly affect the climate of terrestrial exoplanets. We confirm a transition between low and high dayside cloud coverage of synchronously rotating terrestrial planets with increasing rotation period. We determine that this cloud transition is due to eddy-driven convergence near the substellar point and should not be parameterization-dependent. Finally, we compute full-phase light curves from our simulations of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, finding that changing incident stellar flux and rotation period affect observable properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Our GCM results can guide expectations for planetary climate over the broad range of possible terrestrial exoplanets that will be observed with future space telescopes.},

  abstract = {Understanding the anomalous radii of many transiting hot gas giant planets is a fundamental problem of planetary science. Recent detections of re-inflated warm Jupiters orbiting post-main-sequence stars and the re-inflation of hot Jupiters while their host stars evolve on the main-sequence may help constrain models for the anomalous radii of hot Jupiters. In this work, we present evolution models studying the re-inflation of gas giants to determine how varying the depth and intensity of deposited heating affects both main-sequence re-inflation of hot Jupiters and post-main-sequence re-inflation of warm Jupiters. We find that deeper heating is required to re-inflate hot Jupiters than is needed to suppress their cooling, and that the timescale of re-inflation decreases with increasing heating rate and depth. We find a strong degeneracy between heating rate and depth, with either strong shallow heating or weak deep heating providing an explanation for main-sequence re-inflation of hot Jupiters. This degeneracy between heating rate and depth can be broken in the case of post-main-sequence re-inflation of warm Jupiters, as the inflation must be rapid to occur within post-main-sequence evolution timescales. We also show that the dependence of heating rate on incident stellar flux inferred from the sample of hot Jupiters can explain re-inflation of both warm and hot Jupiters. TESS will obtain a large sample of warm Jupiters orbiting post-main-sequence stars, which will help to constrain the mechanism(s) causing the anomalous radii of gas giant planets.},

This signal is also present in the precise radial velocity measurements from CARMENES, confirming the existence of the planet and providing a planetary mass of \$M\_\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{b\} = 6.28\textbackslash backslashpm0.88 M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ and, thus, an estimated bulk density of \$2.45\^\{+0.48\}\_\{-0.42\}\$ g cm\$\^\{-3\}\$.

  abstract = {The WFCAM Transit Survey (WTS) is a near-infrared transit survey running on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), designed to discover planets around M dwarfs. The WTS acts as a poor-seeing backup programme for the telescope, and represents the first dedicated wide-field near-infrared transit survey. In this paper we describe the observing strategy of the WTS and the processing of the data to generate lightcurves. We describe the basic properties of our photometric data, and measure our sensitivity based on 950 observations. We show that the photometry reaches a precision of {$\sim$}4mmag for the brightest unsaturated stars in lightcurves spanning almost 3 years. Optical (SDSS griz) and near-infrared (UKIRT ZYJHK) photometry is used to classify the target sample of 4600 M dwarfs with J magnitudes in the range 11-17. Most have spectral-types in the range M0-M2. We conduct Monte Carlo transit injection and detection simulations for short period (\textbackslash textless10 day) Jupiter- and Neptune-sized planets to characterize the sensitivity of the survey. We investigate the recovery rate as a function of period and magnitude for 4 hypothetical star-planet cases: M0-2+Jupiter, M2-4+Jupiter, M0-2+Neptune, M2-4+Neptune. We find that the WTS lightcurves are very sensitive to the presence of Jupiter-sized short-period transiting planets around M dwarfs. Hot Neptunes produce a much weaker signal and suffer a correspondingly smaller recovery fraction. Neptunes can only be reliably recovered with the correct period around the rather small sample ({$\sim$}100) of the latest M dwarfs (M4-M9) in the WTS. The non-detection of a hot-Jupiter around an M dwarf by the WFCAM Transit Survey allows us to place an upper limit of 1.7-2.0 per cent (at 95 per cent confidence) on the planet occurrence rate.},

After short-periodic terms in the Hamiltonian are eliminated, the degree of freedom for the canonical equations of motion can be reduced to 1. Since there is an energy integral, the equations can be solved by quadrature. When the ratio of the semi-major axes of the asteroid and Jupiter takes a very small value, the solutions are expressed by elliptic functions. When the z component of the angular momentum (that is, Delaunay's H) of the asteroid is smaller than a certain limiting value, there are both a stationary solution and solutions corresponding to libration cases. The limiting value of H increases as the ratio of the semimajor axes increases i.e., the corresponding limiting inclination drops from 39.2 degrees to 1.8 degrees as the ratio of the axes increases from 0.0 to 0.95.},

  abstract = {The streaming instability (SI) has been extensively studied in the linear and non-linear regimes as a mechanism to concentrate solids and trigger planetesimal formation in the midplane of protoplanetary discs. A related dust settling instability (DSI) applies to particles while settling towards the midplane. The DSI has previously been studied in the linear regime, with predictions that it could trigger particle clumping away from the midplane. This work presents a range of linear calculations and non-linear simulations, performed with FARGO3D, to assess conditions for DSI growth. We expand on previous linear analyses by including particle size distributions and performing a detailed study of the amount of background turbulence needed to stabilize the DSI. When including binned size distributions, the DSI often produces converged growth rates with fewer bins than the standard SI. With background turbulence, we find that the most favorable conditions for DSI growth are weak turbulence, characterized by \$\textbackslash backslashalpha \textbackslash backslashlesssim 10\^\{-6\}\$ with intermediate-sized grains that settle from one gas scale-height. These conditions could arise during a sudden decrease in disc turbulence following an accretion outburst. Ignoring background turbulence, we performed a parameter survey of local 2D DSI simulations. Particle clumping was either weak or occurred slower than particles settle. Clumping was reduced by a factor of two in a comparison 3D simulation. Overall, our results strongly disfavor the hypothesis that the DSI significantly promotes planetesimal formation. Non-linear simulations of the DSI with different numerical methods could support or challenge these findings.},

However, the water content of the solar system giant planets is not well known because water is sequestered in clouds deep in their atmospheres. By contrast, short-period exoplanets have such high temperatures that their atmospheres have water in the gas phase, making it possible to measure the water abundance for these objects. We present a precise determination of the water abundance in the atmosphere of the 2 M Jup short-period exoplanet WASP-43b based on thermal emission and transmission spectroscopy measurements obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find the water content is consistent with the value expected in a solar composition gas at planetary temperatures (0.4-3.5 \texttimes{} solar at 1{$\sigma$} confidence). The metallicity of WASP-43b's atmosphere suggested by this result extends the trend observed in the solar system of lower metal enrichment for higher planet masses.},

Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis, the presence of water vapor is tentatively favored with a Bayes factor of 1.7 - 2.6 (depending on prior assumptions).

They are detected by thermal emission of dust released in collisions amongst directly unobservable larger bodies that carry most of the debris disc mass. We estimate the total mass of the discs by extrapolating up the mass of emitting dust with the help of collisional cascade models. The resulting mass of bright debris discs appears to be unrealistically large, exceeding the mass of solids available in the systems at the preceding protoplanetary stage. We discuss this 'mass problem' in detail and investigate possible solutions to it. These include uncertainties in the dust opacity and planetesimal strength, variation of the bulk density with size, steepening of the size distribution by damping processes, the role of the unknown 'collisional age' of the discs, and dust production in recent giant impacts. While we cannot rule out the possibility that a combination of these might help, we argue that the easiest solution would be to assume that planetesimals in systems with bright debris discs were 'born small', with sizes in the kilometre range, especially at large distances from the stars. This conclusion would necessitate revisions to the existing planetesimal formation models, and may have a range of implications for planet formation. We also discuss potential tests to constrain the largest planetesimal sizes and debris disc masses.},

Here we report the discovery that the planet radius distribution exhibits a strong dependence on ambient stellar clustering, characterised by measuring the position-velocity phase space density with Gaia. When dividing the planet sample into `field' and `overdensity' sub-samples, we find that planetary systems in the field exhibit a statistically significant (p = 5.5\texttimes 10-3) dearth of planets below the radius valley compared to systems in phase space overdensities. This implies that the large-scale stellar environment of a planetary system is a key factor setting the planet radius distribution. We discuss how models for the radius valley might be revised following our findings and conclude that a multi-scale, multi-physics scenario is needed, connecting planet formation and evolution, star and stellar cluster formation, and galaxy evolution.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone of late-K and M-dwarf stars are expected to be in synchronous rotation, as a consequence of strong tidal interactions with their host stars. Previous global climate model (GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating planets, strong convection at the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the planetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway. However these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods for synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host star. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the habitable zone for synchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars using a 3-D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar metallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary orbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the efficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation rate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity, planetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the inner edge of the habitable zone is farther away from the host stars than in previous GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime of the substellar clouds begins to transition as the rotation rate approaches {$\sim$}10 days. These faster rotation rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle the planet and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the planetary albedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor greenhouse climatic instability to occur at up to {$\sim$}25\% lower incident stellar fluxes than found in previous GCM studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity and for mid-K to early-M stars, we agree with previous studies.},

We base our results on an independent planet catalogue compiled from our search of all {$\sim$}200,000 stars observed over the Kepler mission, with precise planetary radii supplemented by Gaia DR2-incorporated stellar radii. We take into account detection and vetting efficiency, planet radius uncertainty, and reliability against transit-like noise signals in the data. By analyzing our FGK occurrence rates as well as those computed after separating F, G, and K type stars, we explore dependencies on stellar effective temperature, planet radius, and orbital period. We reveal new characteristics of the photoevaporation-driven "radius gap" between {$\sim$}1.5 - 2 R , indicating that the bimodal distribution previously revealed for P \textbackslash textless 100 days exists only over a much narrower range of orbital periods, above which sub-Neptunes dominate and below which super-Earths dominate.

For planets with sizes 0.75 - 1.5 R orbiting in a conservatively defined Habitable Zone (0.99-1.70 AU) around G type stars, we place an upper limit (84.1th percentile) of \textbackslash textless 0.18 planets per star.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for estimating exoplanet occurrence rates by synthesizing constraints from radial velocity and transit surveys simultaneously. We employ approximate Bayesian computation and various mass-radius (M-R) relations to explore the population models describing these surveys, both separately and in a joint fit. Using this approach, we fit a planet distribution function of the form \$d\^\{2\} N/d\textbackslash backslashlog\{P\}d\textbackslash backslashlog\{M\} \textbackslash backslashpropto P\^\{\textbackslash backslashbeta\} M\^\{\textbackslash backslashalpha\}\$, with a break in the power law in mass at \$M\_\{b\}\$, to planets orbiting FGK stars with periods \$P = [25, 200]\$ days and masses \$M = [2, 50] M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. We find that the M-R relation from Otegi et al. (2020), which lets rocky and volatile-rich populations overlap in mass, allows us to find a model that is consistent with both types of surveys. Our joint fit gives \$M\_\{b\} = 21.6\_\{-3.2\}\^\{+2.5\} M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ (errors reflect 68.3\% credible interval). This is nearly a factor of three higher than the break from transit-only considerations and an M-R relation without such an overlap. The corresponding planet-star mass ratio break \$q\_\{b\} \textbackslash backslashsim 7\textbackslash backslashtimes10\^\{-5\}\$ may be consistent with microlensing studies (\$q\_b \textbackslash backslashsim 6\textbackslash backslashtimes10\^\{-5\} - 2\textbackslash backslashtimes10\^\{-4\}\$). The joint fit also requires that a fraction of \$F\_\{\textbackslash backslashtext\{rocky\}\} = 0.63\_\{-0.04\}\^\{+0.04\}\$ planets in the overlap region belong to the rocky population. Our results strongly suggest that future M-R relations should account for a mixture of distinct types of planets in order to describe the observed planet population.},

We incorporate the mass loss by PEW and the mass loss and magnetic braking (wind torque) by MDW, in addition to the viscous accretion, viscous heating, and stellar irradiation. We find that MDW and PEW respectively have different roles: magnetically driven wind ejects materials from an inner disk in the early phase, whereas photoevaporation has a dominant role in the late phase in the outer (\$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim1\textbackslash backslash,\$au) disk. The disk lifetime, which depends on the combination of MDW, PEW, and viscous accretion, shows a large variation of \$\textbackslash backslashsim1\$-\$20\textbackslash backslash,\$Myr; the gas is dispersed mainly by the MDW and the PEW in the cases with a low viscosity and the lifetime is sensitive to the mass-loss rate and torque of the MDW, whereas the lifetime is insensitive to these parameters when the viscosity is high. Even in disks with very weak turbulence, the cooperation of MDW and PEW enables the disk dispersal within a few Myr.},

  abstract = {We report results from 2 1/2 yr of high precision radial velocity (RV) monitoring of Barnard's star. The high RV measurement precision of the VLT-UT2+UVES of 2.65 m s-1 made the following findings possible. (1) The first detection of the change in the RV of a star caused by its space motion (RV secular acceleration). (2) An anti-correlation of the measured RV with the strength of the filling-in of the H\_alpha line by emission. (3) Very stringent mass upper limits to planetary companions. Using only data from the first 2 years, we obtain a best-fit value for the RV secular acceleration of 5.15+/- 0.89 m s-1 yr-1. This agrees within 0.95sigma with the predicted value of 4.50 m s-1 yr-1 based on the Hipparcos proper motion and parallax combined with the known absolute radial velocity of the star. When the RV data of the last half-year are added the best-fit slope is strongly reduced to 2.97+/- 0.51 m s-1 yr-1 (3.0sigma away from the predicted value), clearly suggesting the presence of additional RV variability in the star. Part of it can be attributed to stellar activity as we demonstrate by correlating the residual RVs with an index that describes the filling-in of the H\_alpha line by emission. A correlation coefficient of -0.50 indicates that the appearance of active regions causes a blueshift of photospheric absorption lines. Assuming that active regions basically inhibit convection we discuss the possibility that the fundamental (inactive) convection pattern in this M4V star produces a convective redshift which would indicate that the majority of the absorption lines relevant for our RV measurements is formed in a region of convective overshoot. This interpretation could possibly extend a trend indicated in the behaviour of earlier spectral types that exhibit convective blueshift, but with decreasing line asymmetries and blueshifts as one goes from G to K dwarfs. Based on this assumption, we estimate that the variation of the visible plage coverage is about 20\%. We also determine upper limits to the projected mass msin i and to the true mass m of hypothetical planetary companions in circular orbits. For the separation range 0.017-0.98 AU we exclude any planet with msin i\textbackslash textgreater 0.12 MJupiter and m\textbackslash textgreater 0.86 MJupiter.

Taking advantage of this, the ExoGRAVITY project is a survey of known young giant exoplanets located in the range of 0.1'' to 2'' from their stars. The observations provide astrometric data of unprecedented accuracy, being crucial for refining the orbital parameters of planets and illuminating their dynamical histories. Furthermore, GRAVITY will measure non-Keplerian perturbations due to planet-planet interactions in multi-planet systems and measure dynamical masses. Over time, repetitive observations of the exoplanets at medium resolution (\$R=500\$) will provide a catalogue of K-band spectra of unprecedented quality, for a number of exoplanets. The K-band has the unique properties that it contains many molecular signatures (CO, H\$\_2\$O, CH\$\_4\$, CO\$\_2\$). This allows constraining precisely surface gravity, metallicity, and temperature, if used in conjunction with self-consistent models like Exo-REM. Further, we will use the parameter-retrieval algorithm petitRADTRANS to constrain the C/O ratio of the planets. Ultimately, we plan to produce the first C/O survey of exoplanets, kick-starting the difficult process of linking planetary formation with measured atomic abundances.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within {$\sim$}2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M{$\odot$}. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

The geological activity is thought to be the result of tides raised by Jupiter, but it is not known whether the current tidal heat production is sufficiently high to generate the observed surface heat flow. Ios tidal heat comes from the orbital energy of the Io-Jupiter system (resulting in orbital acceleration), whereas dissipation of energy in Jupiter causes Ios orbital motion to decelerate. Here we report a determination of the tidal dissipation in Io and Jupiter through its effect on the orbital motions of the Galilean moons. Our results show that the rate of internal energy dissipation in Io (k"2/Q {$\leq$} 0.015{$\pm$}0.003, where k"2 is the Love number and Q is the quality factor) is in good agreement with the observed surface heat flow, and suggest that Io is close to thermal equilibrium. Dissipation in Jupiter (k"2/Q {$\leq$} (1.102{$\pm$}0.203)\texttimes 10-5) is close to the upper bound of its average value expected from the long-term evolution of the system, and dissipation in extrasolar planets may be higher than presently assumed. The measured secular accelerations indicate that Io is evolving inwards, towards Jupiter, and that the three innermost Galilean moons (Io, Europa and Ganymede) are evolving out of the exact Laplace resonance. \textcopyright{} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

  abstract = {The observed lifetimes of gaseous protoplanetary discs place strong constraints on gas and ice giant formation in the core accretion scenario. The approximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the gaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc is completed within 1-10 million years. Building up the core by collisions between km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this timescale constraint, especially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are detected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we numerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles loosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses ranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test different particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our analytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one set by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and the other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere. In the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass, while in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass. We discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant cores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core accretion timescale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in the midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive planetesimals or low radial pressure support. The core growth timescale is shortened by a factor 30-1000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100-10? 000 at 50 AU, compared to the gravitationally focused accretion of, respectively, low-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard km-sized planetesimals. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2012.},

  abstract = {The formation of planetary cores must proceed rapidly in order for the giant planets to accrete their gaseous envelopes before the dissipation of the protoplanetary gas disc (? 3? Myr). In orbits beyond 10? AU, direct accumulation of planetesimals by the cores is too slow. Fragments of planetesimals could be accreted faster, but planetesimals are likely too large for fragmentation to be efficient, and resonant trapping poses an additional hurdle. Here we instead investigate the accretion of small pebbles (mm-cm sizes) that are the natural outcome of an equilibrium between the growth and radial drift of particles. We construct a simplified analytical model of dust coagulation and pebble drift in the outer disc, between 5? AU and 100? AU, which gives the temporal evolution of the solid surface density and the dominant particle size. These two key quantities determine how core growth proceeds at various orbital distances. We find that pebble surface densities are sufficiently high to achieve the inside-out formation of planetary cores within the disc lifetime. The overall efficiency by which dust gets converted to planets can be high, close to 50\% for planetary architectures similar to the solar system. Growth by pebble accretion in the outer disc is sufficiently fast to overcome catastrophic type I migration of the cores. These results require protoplanetary discs with large radial extent (? 100? AU) and assume a low number of initial seed embryos. Our findings imply that protoplanetary discs with low disc masses, as expected around low-mass stars (\textbackslash textless1? M?), or with sub-solar dust-to-gas ratios, do not easily form gas-giant planets (M ? 100 ME), but preferentially form Neptune-mass planets or smaller (M ? 10 ME). This is consistent with exoplanet surveys which show that gas giants are relatively uncommon around stars of low mass or low metallicity.},

  abstract = {In the solar system giant planets come in two flavours: gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) with massive gas envelopes, and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) with much thinner envelopes around their cores. It is poorly understood how these two classes of planets formed. High solid accretion rates, necessary to form the cores of giant planets within the life-time of protoplanetary discs, heat the envelope and prevent rapid gas contraction onto the core, unless accretion is halted. We find that, in fact, accretion of pebbles ({$\sim$}cm sized particles) is self-limiting: when a core becomes massive enough it carves a gap in the pebble disc. This halt in pebble accretion subsequently triggers the rapid collapse of the super-critical gas envelope. Unlike gas giants, ice giants do not reach this threshold mass and can only bind low-mass envelopes that are highly enriched by water vapour from sublimated icy pebbles. This offers an explanation for the compositional difference between gas giants and ice giants in the solar system. Furthermore, unlike planetesimal-driven accretion scenarios, our model allows core formation and envelope attraction within disc life-times, provided that solids in protoplanetary discs are predominantly made up of pebbles. Our results imply that the outer regions of planetary systems, where the mass required to halt pebble accretion is large, are dominated by ice giants and that gas-giant exoplanets in wide orbits are enriched by more than 50 Earth masses of solids.},

  abstract = {Super-Earths \textendash{} planets with sizes between the Earth and Neptune \textendash{} are found in tighter orbits than that of the Earth around more than one third of main sequence stars. It has been proposed that super-Earths are scaled-up terrestrial planets that also formed similarly, through mutual accretion of planetary embryos, but in discs much denser than the solar protoplanetary disc. We argue instead that terrestrial planets and super-Earths have two clearly distinct formation pathways that are regulated by the pebble reservoir of the disc. Through numerical integrations, which combine pebble accretion and N-body gravity between embryos, we show that a difference of a factor of two in the pebble mass flux is enough to change the evolution from the terrestrial to the super-Earth growth mode. If the pebble mass flux is small, then the initial embryos within the ice line grow slowly and do not migrate substantially, resulting in a widely spaced population of approximately Mars-mass embryos when the gas disc dissipates. Subsequently, without gas being present, the embryos become unstable due to mutual gravitational interactions and a small number of terrestrial planets are formed by mutual collisions. The final terrestrial planets are at most five Earth masses. Instead, if the pebble mass flux is high, then the initial embryos within the ice line rapidly become sufficiently massive to migrate through the gas disc. Embryos concentrate at the inner edge of the disc and growth accelerates through mutual merging. This leads to the formation of a system of closely spaced super-Earths in the five to twenty Earth-mass range, bounded by the pebble isolation mass. Generally, instabilities of these super-Earth systems after the disappearance of the gas disc trigger additional merging events and dislodge the system from resonant chains. Therefore, the key difference between the two growth modes is whether embryos grow fast enough to undergo significant migration. The terrestrial growth mode produces small rocky planets on wider orbits like those in the solar system whereas the super-Earth growth mode produces planets in short-period orbits inside 1 AU, with masses larger than the Earth that should be surrounded by a primordial H/He atmosphere, unless subsequently lost by stellar irradiation. The pebble flux \textendash{} which controls the transition between the two growth modes \textendash{} may be regulated by the initial reservoir of solids in the disc or the presence of more distant giant planets that can halt the radial flow of pebbles.},

  abstract = {Past studies addressing the thermal atmospheric escape of hydrogen from hot Jupiters have been based on the planet's effective temperature, which, as we show here, is not physically relevant for loss processes. In consequence, these studies led to significant underestimations of the atmospheric escape rate ({$\leq$}103 g s-1) and to the conclusion of long-term atmospheric stability. From more realistic exospheric temperatures, determined from X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation and thermal conduction in the thermosphere, we find that energy-limited escape and atmospheric expansion arise, leading to much higher estimations for the loss rates ({$\approx$}1012 g s-1). These fluxes are in good agreement with recent determinations for HD 209458b based on observations of its extended exosphere. We also show that for young solar-type stars, which emit stronger XUV fluxes, the inferred loss rates are significantly higher. Thus, hydrogen-rich giant exoplanets under such strong XUV irradiances may evaporate down to their core sizes or shrink to levels at which heavier atmospheric constituents may prevent hydrodynamic escape. These results could explain the apparent paucity of exoplanets so far detected at orbital distances less than 0.04 AU.},

The census of multiples includes 115 targets that show two candidate planets, 45 with three, eight with four, and one each with five and six, for a total of 170 systems with 408 candidates. When compared to the 827 systems with only one candidate, the multiples account for 17\% of the total number of systems, and one-third of all the planet candidates. We compare the characteristics of candidates found in multiples with those found in singles. False positives due to eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected. Singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than Neptune; 69+2-3\% for singles and 86 +2-5\% for multiples. This result, that systems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include a transiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disrupt the orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even prevent the formation of such systems in the first place. \textcopyright{} 2011.

These planets display a wide diversity of properties, yet all are believed to have had their spin periods tidally spin-synchronized with their orbital periods, resulting in permanent star-facing hemispheres and surface flow patterns that are most likely in equilibrium. Planets in significantly eccentric orbits can enable direct measurements of global heating that are largely independent of the details of the hydrodynamic flow. Here we report 8-{$\mu$}m photometric observations of the planet HD 80606b during a 30-hour interval bracketing the periastron passage of its extremely eccentric 111.4-day orbit. As the planet received its strongest irradiation (828 times larger than the flux received at apastron) its maximum 8-{$\mu$}m brightness temperature increased from {$\sim$}800 K to {$\sim$}1,500 K over a six-hour period. We also detected a secondary eclipse for the planet, which implies an orbital inclination of i {$\approx$} 90\textdegree, fixes the planetary mass at four times the mass of Jupiter, and constrains the planet's tidal luminosity. Our measurement of the global heating rate indicates that the radiative time constant at the planet's 8-{$\mu$}m photosphere is {$\sim$}4.5 h, in comparison with 3-5 days in Earth's stratosphere. \textcopyright 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We derive a general analytic expression for how the atmospheric mass grows with time t as a function of the underlying core mass and nebular conditions, including the gas metallicity Z. Planets accrete as much gas as can cool: an atmosphere's doubling time is given by its Kelvin-Helmholtz time. Dusty atmospheres behave differently from atmospheres made dust-free by grain growth and sedimentation. The gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) of a dusty atmosphere scales as GCR , where (for Z not too close to 1) is the mean molecular weight at the innermost radiative-convective boundary. This scaling applies across all orbital distances and nebular conditions for dusty atmospheres; their radiative-convective boundaries, which regulate cooling, are not set by the external environment, but rather by the internal microphysics of dust sublimation, H2 dissociation, and the formation of H-. By contrast, dust-free atmospheres have their radiative boundaries at temperatures close to nebular temperatures , and grow faster at larger orbital distances where cooler temperatures, and by extension lower opacities, prevail. At 0.1 AU in a gas-poor nebula, GCR , while beyond 1 AU in a gas-rich nebula, GCR . We confirm our analytic scalings against detailed numerical models for objects ranging in mass from Mars () to the most extreme super-Earths (10-), and explain why heating from planetesimal accretion cannot prevent the latter from undergoing runaway gas accretion.},

There exists a clear gap in the distribution of radii that separates these two kinds of planets. Mass loss processes like photoevaporation by high energy photons from the host star have been proposed as natural mechanisms to carve out this radius valley. These models favor underlying core mass function of sub-Neptunes that is sharply peaked at \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$6\textendash 8\$M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ but the radial-velocity follow-up of these small planets hint at a more bottom-heavy mass function. By taking into account the initial gas accretion in gas-poor (but not gas-empty) nebula, we demonstrate that the observed radius valley can be reconciled with core mass functions that are broad extending well into sub-Earth regime. The maximally cooled isothermal limit prohibits cores lighter than \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$1\textendash 2\$M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ from accreting enough mass to appear gas-enveloped. The rocky-to-enveloped transition established at formation produces a gap in the radius distribution that shifts to smaller radii farther from the star, similar to that observed. For the best agreement with the data, our late-time gas accretion model followed by photoevaporative mass loss favors dust-free accretion in hotter disks with a core mass function that is as broad as \$dN/dM\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm core\} \textbackslash backslashpropto M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm core\}\^\{-0.7\}\$.},

  abstract = {While it is generally accepted that the magnetic field and its non-ideal effects play important roles during the stellar formation, simple models of pure hydrodynamics and angular momentum conservation are still widely employed in the studies of disk assemblage in the framework of the so-called "alpha-disk" model due to their simplicity. There has only been a few efforts trying to bridge the gap between a collapsing prestellar core and a developed disk. The goal of the present work is to revisit the assemblage of the protoplanetary disk (PPD), by performing 3D MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and full radiative transfer. We follow the global evolution of the PPD from the prestellar core collapse for 100 kyr, with resolution of one AU. The formed disk is more realistic and is in agreement with recent observations of disks around class-0 young stellar objects. The mass flux arriving onto the disk and the radial mass accretion rate within the disk are measured and compared to analytical self-similar models. The surface mass flux is very centrally peaked, implying that most of the mass falling onto the star does not transit through the mid-plane of the disk. The disk mid-plane is almost dead to turbulence, whereas upper layers and the disk outer edge are very turbulent. The snow-line is significantly further away than in a passive disk. We developed a zoomed rerun technique to quickly obtain a reasonable disk that is highly stratified, weakly magnetized inside, and strongly magnetized outside. During the class-0 phase of PPD formation, the interaction between the disk and the infalling envelope is important and ought not be neglected. Accretion onto the star is found to mostly depend on dynamics of the collapsing envelope, rather than the detailed disk structure.},

At lower viscosities previous studies, based on 2D simulations have shown that migration can be very chaotic and often characterized by phases of fast migration. The reason is that in low-viscosity discs vortices appear due to the Rossby-wave instability at the edges of the gap opened by the planet. Migration is then determined by vortex-planet interactions. Our aim is to study migration in low viscosity 3D discs. We performed numerical simulations using 2D (including self-gravity) and 3D codes. After selecting disc masses for which self-gravity is not important, 3D simulations without self-gravity can be safely used. In our nominal simulation only numerical viscosity is present. We then performed simulations with prescribed viscosity to assess the threshold below which the new migration processes appear. We show that for alpha viscosity \textbackslash textless= 1.e-5 two migration modes are possible which differ from classical Type-II migration, in the sense that they are not proportional to the disc's viscosity. The first occurs when the gap opened by the planet is not very deep. This occurs in 3D simulations and/or when a big vortex forms at the outer edge of the planetary gap, diffusing material into the gap. We call this type of migration "vortex-driven migration". This migration is very slow and cannot continue indefinitely, because eventually the vortex dissolves. The second migration mode occurs when the gap is deep so that the planet's eccentricity grows to a value {$\sim$}0.2 due to inefficient eccentricity damping by corotation resonances. This second, faster migration mode appears to be typical of 2D models in discs with slower damping of temperature's perturbations.},

  abstract = {Determining the architecture of multi-planetary systems is one of the cornerstones of understanding planet formation and evolution. Resonant systems are especially important as the fragility of their orbital configuration ensures that no significant scattering or collisional event has taken place since the earliest formation phase when the parent protoplanetary disc was still present. In this context, TOI-178 has been the subject of particular attention since the first TESS observations hinted at a 2:3:3 resonant chain. Here we report the results of observations from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO, NGTS, and SPECULOOS with the aim of deciphering the peculiar orbital architecture of the system. We show that TOI-178 harbours at least six planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regimes, with radii ranging from 1.152(-0.070/+0.073) to 2.87(-0.13/+0.14) Earth radii and periods of 1.91, 3.24, 6.56, 9.96, 15.23, and 20.71 days. All planets but the innermost one form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain of Laplace resonances, and the planetary densities show important variations from planet to planet, jumping from 1.02(+0.28/-0.23) to 0.177(+0.055/-0.061) times the Earth's density between planets c and d. Using Bayesian interior structure retrieval models, we show that the amount of gas in the planets does not vary in a monotonous way, contrary to what one would expect from simple formation and evolution models and unlike other known systems in a chain of Laplace resonances. The brightness of TOI-178 allows for a precise characterisation of its orbital architecture as well as of the physical nature of the six presently known transiting planets it harbours. The peculiar orbital configuration and the diversity in average density among the planets in the system will enable the study of interior planetary structures and atmospheric evolution, providing important clues on the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.},

  abstract = {The CHEOPS space mission dedicated to exoplanet follow-up was launched in December 2019, equipped with the capacity to perform photometric measurements at the 20 ppm level. As CHEOPS carries out its observations in a broad optical passband, it can provide insights into the reflected light from exoplanets and constrain the short-wavelength thermal emission for the hottest of planets by observing occultations and phase curves. Here, we report the first CHEOPS observation of an occultation, namely, that of the hot Jupiter WASP-189b, a \$M\_P \textbackslash backslashapprox 2 M\_J\$ planet orbiting an A-type star. We detected the occultation of WASP-189 b at high significance in individual measurements and derived an occultation depth of \$dF = 87.9 \textbackslash backslashpm 4.3\$ppm based on four occultations. We compared these measurements to model predictions and we find that they are consistent with an unreflective atmosphere heated to a temperature of \$3435 \textbackslash backslashpm 27\$K, when assuming inefficient heat redistribution. Furthermore, we present two transits of WASP-189b observed by CHEOPS. These transits have an asymmetric shape that we attribute to gravity darkening of the host star caused by its high rotation rate. We used these measurements to refine the planetary parameters, finding a \$\textbackslash backslashsim25\textbackslash backslash\%\$ deeper transit compared to the discovery paper and updating the radius of WASP-189b to \$1.619\textbackslash backslashpm0.021 R\_J\$. We further measured the projected orbital obliquity to be \$\textbackslash backslashlambda = 86.4\^\{+2.9\}\_\{-4.4\}\$deg, a value that is in good agreement with a previous measurement from spectroscopic observations, and derived a true obliquity of \$\textbackslash backslashPsi = 85.4\textbackslash backslashpm4.3\$deg. Finally, we provide reference values for the photometric precision attained by the CHEOPS satellite: for the V=6.6 mag star, and using a one-hour binning, we obtain a residual RMS between 10 and 17ppm on the individual light curves, and 5.7ppm when combining the four visits.},

The result \textemdash{} a radial planetesimal distribution \textemdash{} can be used as initial condition to study the formation of planetary embryos. We follow the idea that one needs particle traps to locally enhance the dust-to-gas ratio sufficiently such that particle gas interactions can no longer prevent planetesimal formation on small scales. The location of these traps can emerge everywhere in the disk. Their occurrence and lifetime is subject of ongoing research, thus they are implemented via free parameters. This enables us to study the influence of the disk properties on the formation of planetesimals, predicting their time dependent formation rates and location of primary pebble accretion. We show that large \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$-values of \$0.01\$ (strong turbulence) prevent the formation of planetesimals in the inner part of the disk, arguing for lower values of around \$0.001\$ (moderate turbulence), at which planetesimals form quickly at all places where they are needed for proto-planets. Planetesimals form as soon as dust has grown to pebbles (\$\textbackslash backslashsim\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{mm\}\$ to \$\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{dm\}\$) and the pebble flux reaches a critical value, which is after a few thousand years at \$2-3\textbackslash backslash,\$AU and after a few hundred thousand years at \$20-30\textbackslash backslash,\$AU. Planetesimal formation lasts until the pebble supply has decreased below a critical value. The final spatial planetesimal distribution is steeper compared to the initial dust and gas distribution which helps to explain the discrepancy between the minimum mass solar nebula and viscous accretion disks.},

  abstract = {The properties of the first-discovered interstellar object (ISO), 1I/2017 (`Oumuamua), differ from both Solar System asteroids and comets, casting doubt on a protoplanetary disk origin. In this study, we investigate the possibility that it formed with a substantial H2 ice component in the starless core of a giant molecular cloud. While interstellar solid hydrogen has yet to be detected, this constituent would explain a number of the ISO's properties. We consider the relevant processes required to build decameter-sized, solid hydrogen bodies and assess the plausibility of growth in various size regimes. Via an energy balance argument, we find that the most severe barrier to formation is the extremely low temperature required for the favorability of molecular hydrogen ice. However, if deposition occurs, we find that the turbulence within starless cores is conducive for growth into kilometer-sized bodies on sufficiently short timescales. Then, we analyze mass loss in the interstellar medium and determine the necessary size for a hydrogen object to survive a journey to the Solar System as a function of ISO age. Finally, we discuss the implications if the H2 explanation is correct, and we assess the future prospects of ISO science. If hydrogen ice ISOs do exist, our hypothesized formation pathway would require a small population of porous, 100 micron dust in a starless core region that has cooled to 2.8K via adiabatic expansion of the surrounding gas and excellent shielding from electromagnetic radiation and cosmic rays.},

  abstract = {We present the first secondary eclipse and phase curve observations for the highly eccentric hot Jupiter HAT-P-2b in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 {$\mu$}m bands of the Spitzer Space Telescope. The 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m data sets span an entire orbital period of HAT-P-2b (P = 5.6334729 d), making them the longest continuous phase curve observations obtained to date and the first full-orbit observations of a planet with an eccentricity exceeding 0.2. We present an improved non-parametric method for removing the intrapixel sensitivity variations in Spitzer data at 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m that robustly maps position-dependent flux variations. We find that the peak in planetary flux occurs at 4.39 {$\pm$} 0.28, 5.84 {$\pm$} 0.39, and 4.68 {$\pm$} 0.37 hr after periapse passage with corresponding maxima in the planet/star flux ratio of 0.1138\% {$\pm$} 0.0089\%, 0.1162\% {$\pm$} 0.0080\%, and 0.1888\% {$\pm$} 0.0072\% in the 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 {$\mu$}m bands, respectively. Our measured secondary eclipse depths of 0.0996\% {$\pm$} 0.0072\%, 0.1031\% {$\pm$} 0.0061\%, , and 0.1392\% {$\pm$} 0.0095\% in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 {$\mu$}m bands, respectively, indicate that the planet cools significantly from its peak temperature before we measure the dayside flux during secondary eclipse. We compare our measured secondary eclipse depths to the predictions from a one-dimensional radiative transfer model, which suggests the possible presence of a transient day side inversion in HAT-P-2b's atmosphere near periapse. We also derive improved estimates for the system parameters, including its mass, radius, and orbital ephemeris. Our simultaneous fit to the transit, secondary eclipse, and radial velocity data allows us to determine the eccentricity (e = 0.50910 {$\pm$} 0.00048) and argument of periapse (\$\o mega\$ = 188.\textdegree 09 {$\pm$} 0.\textdegree 39) of HAT-P-2b's orbit with a greater precision than has been achieved for any other eccentric extrasolar planet. We also find evidence for a long-term linear trend in the radial velocity data. This trend suggests the presence of another substellar companion in the HAT-P-2 system, which could have caused HAT-P-2b to migrate inward to its present-day orbit via the Kozai mechanism. \textcopyright{} 2013.

Here we present a suite of three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models for HAT-P-2b that investigate the effects of assumed atmospheric composition and rotation rate on global scale winds and thermal patterns. We compare and contrast atmospheric models for HAT-P-2b, which assume one and five times solar metallicity, both with and without TiO/VO as atmospheric constituents. Additionally we compare models that assume a rotation period of half, one, and two times the nominal pseudo-synchronous rotation period. We find that changes in assumed atmospheric metallicity and rotation rate do not significantly affect model predictions of the planetary flux as a function of orbital phase. However, models in which TiO/VO are present in the atmosphere develop a transient temperature inversion between the transit and secondary eclipse events that results in significant variations in the timing and magnitude of the peak of the planetary flux compared with models in which TiO/VO are omitted from the opacity tables. We find that no one single atmospheric model can reproduce the recently observed full orbit phase curves at 3.6, 4.5 and 8.0 {$\mu$}m, which is likely due to a chemical process not captured by our current atmospheric models for HAT-P-2b. Further modeling and observational efforts focused on understanding the chemistry of HAT-P-2b's atmosphere are needed and could provide key insights into the interplay between radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes in a wide range of exoplanet atmospheres.},

However, the distribution of compositionally Earth-like planets remains insufficiently constrained 3 , and it is not clear whether the Solar System is a statistical outlier or can be explained by more general planetary formation processes. Here we use numerical models of planet formation, evolution and interior structure to show that a planet's bulk water fraction and radius are anti-correlated with initial 26 Al levels in the planetesimal-based accretion framework. The heat generated by this short-lived radionuclide rapidly dehydrates planetesimals 8 before their accretion onto larger protoplanets and yields a system-wide correlation 9,10 of planetary bulk water abundances, which, for instance, can explain the lack of a clear orbital trend in the water budgets of the TRAPPIST-1 planets 11 . Qualitatively, our models suggest two main scenarios for the formation of planetary systems: high- 26 Al systems, like our Solar System, form small, water-depleted planets, whereas those devoid of 26 Al predominantly form ocean worlds. For planets of similar mass, the mean planetary transit radii of the ocean planet population can be up to about 10\% larger than for planets from the 26 Al-rich formation scenario.},

For this purpose, the photometric data of 40 nearby ultra-cool dwarfs were reanalysed in a self-consistent and fully automated manner starting from the raw images. The pipeline developed specifically for this task generates differential light curves, removes non-planetary photometric features and stellar variability, and searches for transits. It identifies the transits of TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c without any human intervention. To test the pipeline and the potential output of similar surveys, we injected planetary transits into the light curves on a star-by-star basis and tested whether the pipeline is able to detect them. The achieved photometric precision enables us to identify Earth-sized planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs as validated by the injection tests. Our planet-injection simulation further suggests a lower limit of 10 per cent on the occurrence rate of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1b with a radius between 1 and 1.3 \$R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ and the orbital period between 1.4 and 1.8 days.},

  abstract = {The known population of exoplanets exhibits a much wider range of orbital eccentricities than Solar System planets and has a much higher average eccentricity. These facts have been widely interpreted to indicate that the Solar System is an atypical member of the overall population of planetary systems. We report here on a strong anti-correlation of orbital eccentricity with multiplicity (number of planets in the system) among catalogued RV systems. The mean, median and rough distribution of eccentricities of Solar System planets fits an extrapolation of this anti-correlation to the eight planet case rather precisely. Thus, the Solar System is not anomalous among known exoplanetary systems with respect to eccentricities when its multiplicity is taken into account. Specifically, as the multiplicity of a system increases the eccentricity decreases roughly as a power law of index -1.20. A simple and plausible but ad hoc model of this relationship implies that approximately 80\% of the one planet and 25\% of the two planet systems in our sample have additional, as yet undiscovered, members. If low eccentricities favor high multiplicities, habitability may be more common in systems with a larger number of planets.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure.

Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

  abstract = {Pebble accretion refers to the assembly of rocky planet cores from particles whose velocity dispersions are damped by drag from circumstellar disc gas. Accretion cross-sections can approach maximal Hill-sphere scales for particles whose Stokes numbers approach unity. While fast, pebble accretion is also lossy. Gas drag brings pebbles to protocores but also sweeps them past; those particles with the largest accretion cross-sections also have the fastest radial drift speeds and are the most easily drained out of discs. We present a global model of planet formation by pebble accretion that keeps track of the disc's mass budget. Cores, each initialized with a lunar mass, grow from discs whose finite stores of mm-cm-sized pebbles drift inward across all radii in viscously accreting gas. For every 1M{$\oplus$} netted by a core, at least 10M{$\oplus$} and possibly much more are lost to radial drift. Core growth rates are typically exponentially sensitive to particle Stokes number, turbulent Mach number, and solid surface density. This exponential sensitivity, when combined with disc migration, tends to generate binary outcomes from 0.1 to 30 au: either sub-Earth cores remain sub-Earth, or explode into Jupiters, with the latter migrating inward to varying degrees. When Jupiter-breeding cores assemble from mm-cm-sized pebbles, they do so in discs where such particles drain out in {$\sim$}105 yr or less; such fast-draining discs do not fit mm-wave observations.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Recent observations have revealed the existence of multiple-planet systems composed of Earth-mass planets around late M dwarfs. Most of their orbits are close to commensurabilities, which suggests that planets were commonly trapped in resonant chains in their formation around low-mass stars. We investigate the formation of multiple-planet systems in resonant chains around low-mass stars. A time-evolution model of the multiple-planet formation via pebble accretion in the early phase of the disk evolution is constructed based on the formation model for the TRAPPIST-1 system by Ormel et al. (2017). Our simulations show that knowing the protoplanet appearance timescale is important for determining the number of planets and their trapped resonances: as the protoplanet appearance timescale increases, fewer planets are formed, which are trapped in more widely separated resonances. We find that there is a range of the protoplanet appearance timescale for forming the stable multiple-planet systems in resonant chains. This range depends on the stellar mass and disk size. We suggest that the protoplanet appearance timescale is a key parameter for studying the formation of multiple-planet systems with planets in resonant chains around low-mass stars. The composition of the planets in our model is also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines a unified scenario for Solar System formation consistent with astrophysical constraints. Jupiter's core could have grown by runaway accretion of planetesimals to a mass sufficient to initiate rapid accretion of gas in times of order of 5 x 105-106 years, provided the surface density of solids in its accretion zone was at least 5-10 times greater than that required by minimum mass models of the protoplanetary disk. After Jupiter had accreted large amounts of nebular gas, it could have gravitationally scattered the planetesimals remaining nearby into orbits which led to escape from the Solar System. Most of the planetesimals in the Mars-asteroids accretion zone could have been perturbed into Jupiter-crossing orbits by resonances with Jupiter and/or interactions with bodies scattered inwards from Jupiter's accretion zone; such Jupiter-crossing orbits would have subsequently led to ejection from the Solar System. However, removal of excess mass from sunward of 1 AU would have been much more difficult. The inner planets and the asteroids can be accounted for in this picture if the surface density of the solar nebula was relatively uniform (decreasing no more rapidly than r- 1 2) out to Jupiter's orbit. The total mass of the protoplanetary disk could have been less than one-tenth of a solar mass provided the surface density dropped off more steeply than r-1 beyond the orbit of Saturn. The outer regions of the nebula would still have contained enough solid matter to explain the growth of Uranus and Neptune in 5 x 106-108 years, together with the coincident ejection of comets to the Oort cloud. The formation of such a protoplanetary disk requires significant transport of mass and angular momentum, and is consistent with viscous accretion disk models of the solar nebula. \textcopyright{} 1987.},

There are 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8 with four, and 1 each with five and six. We characterize the dynamical properties of these candidate multi-planet systems. The distribution of observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low-order mean-motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly near the 2:1 resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are stable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius relationship. Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systems that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of singly transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a population of systems with multiple super-Earth-size and Neptune-size planets with low to moderate mutual inclinations. \textcopyright{} 2011.

  abstract = {Mini-Neptunes and volatile-poor super-Earths coexist on adjacent orbits in proximity to host stars such as Kepler-36 and Kepler-11. Several post-formation processes have been proposed for explaining the origin of the compositional diversity between neighboring planets: mass loss via stellar XUV irradiation, degassing of accreted material, and in situ accumulation of the disk gas. Close-in planets are also likely to experience giant impacts during the advanced stage of planet formation. This study examines the possibility of transforming volatile-rich super-Earths/mini-Neptunes into volatile-depleted super-Earths through giant impacts. We present the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of giant impacts in the accretionary and disruptive regimes. Target planets are modeled with a three-layered structure composed of an iron core, silicate mantle, and hydrogen/helium envelope. In the disruptive case, the giant impact can remove most of the H/He atmosphere immediately and homogenize the refractory material in the planetary interior. In the accretionary case, the planet is able to retain more than half of the original gaseous envelope, while a compositional gradient suppresses efficient heat transfer as the planetary interior undergoes double-diffusive convection. After the giant impact, a hot and inflated planet cools and contracts slowly. The extended atmosphere enhances the mass loss via both a Parker wind induced by thermal pressure and hydrodynamic escape driven by the stellar XUV irradiation. As a result, the entire gaseous envelope is expected to be lost due to the combination of those processes in both cases. Based on our results, we propose that Kepler-36b may have been significantly devolatilized by giant impacts, while a substantial fraction of Kepler-36c's atmosphere may remain intact. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of giant impacts may account for the observed large dispersion in the mass-radius relationship of close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes (at least to some extent).},

  abstract = {Context. Coagulation theory predicts that micron-sized dust grains grow into pebbles which drift inward towards the star, when they reach sizes of mm-cm. When they cross the orbit of a planet, a fraction of these drifting pebbles will be accreted. In the pebble accretion mechanism, the combined effects of the planet's gravitational attraction and gas drag greatly increase the accretion rate. Aims. We calculate the pebble accretion efficiency {$\epsilon$}2D \textendash{} the probability a pebble is accreted by the planet \textendash{} in the 2D limit (pebbles reside in the midplane). In particular, we investigate the dependence of {$\epsilon$}2D on the planet eccentricity and its implications for planet formation models. Methods. We conduct N-body simulations to calculate the pebble accretion efficiency in both the local frame and the global frame. With the global method we investigate the pebble accretion efficiency when the planet is on an eccentric orbit. Results. We find that the local and the global methods generally give consistent results. However, the global method becomes more accurate when the planet is more massive than a few Earth masses or when the aerodynamic size (Stokes number) of the pebble is larger than 1. The efficiency increases with the planet's eccentricity once the relative velocity between the pebble and the planet is determined by the planet's eccentric velocity. At large eccentricities, however, the relative velocity becomes too large for pebble accretion. The efficiency then drops significantly and the accretion enters the ballistic regime. We present general expressions for {$\epsilon$}2D. Applying the obtained formula to the formation of a secondary planet, in resonance with an already-formed giant planet, we find that the embryo grows quickly due to its larger eccentricity. Conclusions. The maximum {$\epsilon$}2D for a planet on an eccentric orbit is several times higher than for a planet on a circular orbit, but this increase gives the planet an important headstart and boosts its following mass growth. The recipe for {$\epsilon$}2D that we have obtained is designed to be implemented into N-body codes to simulate the growth and evolution of planetary systems.},

By Monte Carlo sampling of the initial conditions, the growth and migration of a large number of individual protoplanetary embryos were simulated in a population synthesis manner. We tested two hypotheses for the birth locations of embryos: at the water ice line or log-uniformly distributed over entire protoplanetary disks. Two types of disks with different turbulent viscous parameters               {$\alpha$}                                t                              of 10               -3               and 10               -4               are also investigated to shed light on the role of outward migration of protoplanets. The forming planets are compared with the observed exoplanets in terms of mass, semimajor axis, metallicity, and water content. We find that gas giant planets are likely to form when the characteristic disk sizes are larger, the disk accretion rates are higher, the disks are more metal rich, and/or their stellar hosts are more massive. Our model shows that first, the characteristic mass of super-Earth is set by the pebble isolation mass. Super-Earth masses increase linearly with the mass of its stellar host, which corresponds to one Earth mass around a late M-dwarf star and 20 Earth masses around a solar-mass star. Second, the low-mass planets, up to 20~               M               {$\oplus$}               , can form around stars with a wide range of metallicities, while massive gas giant planets are preferred to grow around metal rich stars. Third, super-Earth planets that are mainly composed of silicates, with relatively low water fractions, can form from protoplanetary embryos at the water ice line in weakly turbulent disks where outward migration is suppressed. However, if the embryos are formed over a wide range of radial distances, the super-Earths would end up having a distinctive, bimodal composition in water mass. Altogether, our model succeeds in quantitatively reproducing several important observed properties of exoplanets and correlations with their stellar hosts.},

We find that the initial protoplanets form with masses that increase with host mass and orbital distance, and decrease with age. Around late M-dwarfs of 0.1~               M               {$\odot$}               , these protoplanets can grow up to Earth-mass planets by pebble accretion.

Around these low-mass stars and brown dwarfs we find no channel for gas giant planet formation because the solid cores remain too small. When the initial protoplanets form only at the water-ice line, the final planets typically have {$\greaterequivlnt$}15\% water mass fraction. Alternatively, when the initial protoplanets form log-uniformly distributed over the entire protoplanetary disk, the final planets are either very water rich (water mass fraction {$\greaterequivlnt$}15\%) or entirely rocky (water mass fraction {$\lessequivlnt$}5\%).},

The diversity in the chemical compositions of planet hosting stars relative to their comparison stars could reflect the range of possible planet-induced effects present in these planet hosts, from the sequestration of rocky material (refractory poor), to the possible ingestion of planets (refractory rich). Other possible explanations include differences in the timescale, efficiency and degree of planet formation or inhomogeneous chemical evolution.

Although several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the origin of such rings, a common explanation is that they trace new-born planets. Under the planetary hypothesis, a natural question is how to reconcile the apparently high frequency of gap-carving planets at 10-100 au with the paucity of Jupiter-mass planets observed around main-sequence stars at those separations. Here, we provide an analysis of the new-born planet population emerging from observations of gaps in discs, under the assumption that the observed gaps are due to planets. We use a simple estimate of the planet mass based on the gap morphology, and apply it to a sample of gaps recently obtained by us in a survey of Taurus with ALMA. We also include additional data from recent published surveys, thus analysing the largest gap sample to date, for a total of 48 gaps. The properties of the purported planets occupy a distinctively different region of parameter space with respect to the known exo-planet population, currently not accessible through planet finding methods. Thus, no discrepancy in the mass and radius distribution of the two populations can be claimed at this stage. We show that the mass of the inferred planets conforms to the theoretically expected trend for the minimum planet mass needed to carve a dust gap. Finally, we estimate the separation and mass of the putative planets after accounting for migration and accretion, for a range of evolutionary times, finding a good match with the distribution of cold Jupiters.},

The CI chondrites match solar abundances in refractory lithophile, siderophile, and volatile elements. All other chondrite groups differ from CI chondrites. With analytical uncertainties, there are no obvious fractionations between CI meteorites and solar abundances.Further progress will primarily come from improved solar abundance determinations.

  abstract = {The mass of a protoplanetary disk limits the formation and future growth of any planet. Masses of protoplanetary disks are usually calculated from measurements of the dust continuum emission by assuming an interstellar gas-to-dust ratio. To investigate the utility of CO as an alternate probe of disk mass, we use ALMA to survey 13CO and C18O J = 3 - 2 line emission from a sample of 93 protoplanetary disks around stars and brown dwarfs with masses from 0.03 \textendash{} 2 M{$\Sun$} in the nearby Chamaeleon I star-forming region. We detect 13CO emission from 17 sources and C18O from only one source. Gas masses for disks are then estimated by comparing the CO line luminosities to results from published disk models that include CO freeze-out and isotope-selective photodissociation. Under the assumption of a typical ISM CO-to-H2 ratios of 10-4, the resulting gas masses are implausibly low, with an average gas mass of {$\sim$} 0.05 MJup as inferred from the average flux of stacked 13CO lines. The low gas masses and gas-to-dust ratios for Cha I disks are both consistent with similar results from disks in the Lupus star-forming region. The faint CO line emission may instead be explained if disks have much higher gas masses, but freeze-out of CO or complex C-bearing molecules is underestimated in disk models. The conversion of CO flux to CO gas mass also suffers from uncertainties in disk structures, which could affect gas temperatures. CO emission lines will only be a good tracer of the disk mass when models for C and CO depletion are confirmed to be accurate.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that stellar clustering plays an important role in shaping the properties of planetary systems. We investigate how the multiplicity distributions and orbital periods of planetary systems depend on the 6D phase space density of stars surrounding planet host systems. We find that stars in high stellar phase space density environments (overdensities) have a factor 1.6 - 2.0 excess in the number of single planet systems compared to stars in low stellar phase space density environments (the field). The multiplicity distribution of planets around field stars is much flatter (i.e. there is a greater fraction of multi-planet systems) than in overdensities. This result is primarily driven by the combined facts that: (i) `hot Jupiters' (HJs) are almost exclusively found in overdensities; (ii) HJs are predominantly observed to be single-planet systems. Nevertheless, we find that the difference in multiplicity is even more pronounced when only considering planets in the Kepler sample, which contains few HJs. This suggests that the Kepler dichotomy \textendash{} an apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet \textendash{} plausibly arises from environmental perturbations. In overdensities, the orbital periods of single-planet systems are smaller than orbital periods of multiple-planet systems. As this difference is more pronounced in overdensities, the mechanism responsible for this effect may be enhanced by stellar clustering. Taken together, the pronounced dependence of planetary multiplicity and orbital period distributions on stellar clustering provides a potentially powerful tool to diagnose the impact of environment on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

The joint use of Bayesian inference tools and frequency analysis has been shown effective to reveal exoplanets but they have been used less frequently to investigate stellar activity. We intend to use radial velocity data of the exoplanet host star GJ 3512 to investigate its magnetic activity. Our study includes the analysis of the photometric data available. The main objectives of our work are to constrain the orbital parameters of the exoplanets in the system, to determine the current level of activity of the star and to derive an activity cycle length for it. An adaptive importance sampling method was used to determine the parameters of the exoplanets orbit. Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms were constructed with both radial velocity curve and photometric data. A careful analysis of the harmonic frequencies was conducted in each periodogram. Our fit to multiple Keplerian orbits constrained the orbital parameters of two giant gas planets orbiting the star GJ 3512. The host star showed an increase of its magnetic activity during the last observing campaign. The accurate fit of the radial velocity curve data to the multi-Keplerian orbit permitted to reveal the star rotation in the residuals of the best fit and estimate an activity cycle length of {$\sim$} 14 years.},

  abstract = {We use models of thermal evolution and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) driven mass loss to explore the composition and history of low-mass, low-density transiting planets. We investigate the Kepler-11 system in detail and provide estimates of both the current and past planetary compositions. We find that an H/He envelope on Kepler-11b is highly vulnerable to mass loss. By comparing to formation models, we show that in situ formation of the system is extremely difficult. Instead we propose that it is a water-rich system of sub-Neptunes that migrated from beyond the snow line. For the broader population of observed planets, we show that there is a threshold in bulk planet density and incident flux above which no low-mass transiting planets have been observed. We suggest that this threshold is due to the instability of H/He envelopes to XUV-driven mass loss. Importantly, we find that this mass-loss threshold is well reproduced by our thermal evolution/contraction models that incorporate a standard mass-loss prescription. Treating the planets' contraction history is essential because the planets have significantly larger radii during the early era of high XUV fluxes. Over time low-mass planets with H/He envelopes can be transformed into water-dominated worlds with steam envelopes or rocky super-Earths. Finally, we use this threshold to provide likely minimum masses and radial-velocity amplitudes for the general population of Kepler candidates. Likewise, we use this threshold to provide constraints on the maximum radii of low-mass planets found by radial-velocity surveys. \textcopyright{} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

We show that the large contrast in mean planetary density observed by Carter et al. can be explained as a natural consequence of photo-evaporation from planets that formed with similar initial compositions. However, rather than being due to differences in XUV irradiation between the planets, we find that this contrast is due to the difference in the masses of the planets' rock/iron cores and the impact that this has on mass-loss evolution. We explore in detail how our coupled models depend on irradiation, mass, age, composition, and the efficiency of mass loss. Based on fits to large numbers of coupled evolution and mass-loss runs, we provide analytic fits to understand threshold XUV fluxes for significant atmospheric loss, as a function of core mass and mass-loss efficiency. Finally we discuss these results in the context of recent studies of the radius distribution of Kepler candidates. Using our parameter study, we make testable predictions for the frequency of sub-Neptune-sized planets. We show that 1.8-4.0 R {$\oplus$} planets should become significantly less common on orbits within 10 days and discuss the possibility of a narrow "occurrence valley" in the radius-flux distribution. Moreover, we describe how photo-evaporation provides a natural explanation for the recent observations of Ciardi et al. that inner planets are preferentially smaller within the systems. \textcopyright{} 2013.

In order to aid in the physical interpretation of these radii, we compute model radii for low-mass rocky planets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. We provide model radii for planets 1-20 M {$\oplus$}, with envelope fractions 0.01\%-20\%, levels of irradiation 0.1-1000 times Earth's, and ages from 100 Myr to 10 Gyr. In addition we provide simple analytic fits that summarize how radius depends on each of these parameters. Most importantly, we show that at fixed H/He envelope fraction, radii show little dependence on mass for planets with more than 1\% of their mass in their envelope. Consequently, planetary radius is to a first order a proxy for planetary composition, i.e., H/He envelope fraction, for Neptune- and sub-Neptune-sized planets. We recast the observed mass-radius relationship as a mass-composition relationship and discuss it in light of traditional core accretion theory. We discuss the transition from rocky super-Earths to sub-Neptune planets with large volatile envelopes. We suggest 1.75 R {$\oplus$} as a physically motivated dividing line between these two populations of planets.

Subsequent analysis showed that at {$\sim$}1.5 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\}\$ there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky super-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile envelopes to explain their low densities. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will be critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency of potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky super-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have lost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes, or they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets, which never had significant envelopes. We suggest an observational path forward to distinguish between these scenarios. Using models of atmospheric photo-evaporation we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated cores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys push to longer orbital periods. On the other hand, if most rocky planets formed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without initial gaseous envelopes. In this case, we use N-body simulations of planet formation to show that the transition radius should increase with orbital period. Moreover, we show that distinguishing between these two scenarios should be possible in coming years with radial velocity follow-up of planets found by TESS. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of this work for current efforts to measure \$\textbackslash backslasheta\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\}\$, which may yield significant overestimates if most rocky planets form as evaporated cores.},

  abstract = {A primary goal of exoplanet characterization is to use a planet's current composition to understand how that planet formed. For example, the C/O ratio has long been recognized as carrying important information on the chemistry of volatile species. Refractory elements, like Fe, Mg, and Si, are usually not considered in this conversation because they condense into solids like Fe(s) or MgSiO\$\_3\$ and would be removed from the observable, gaseous atmosphere in exoplanets cooler than about 2000{$\sim$}K. However, planets hotter than about 2000{$\sim$}K, called ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs), are warm enough to largely avoid the condensation of refractory species. In this paper, we explore the insight that the measurement of refractory abundances can provide into a planet's origins. Through refractory-to-volatile elemental abundance ratios, we can estimate a planet's atmospheric rock-to-ice fraction and constrain planet formation and migration scenarios. We first relate a planet's present-day refractory-to-volatile ratio to its rock-to-ice ratio from formation using various compositional models for the rocky and icy components of the protoplanetary disk. We discuss potential confounding factors like the sequestration of heavy metals in the core and condensation. We then show such a measurement using atmospheric retrievals of the low-resolution UV-IR transmission spectrum of WASP-121b with PETRA, from which we estimate a refractory-to-volatile ratio of 3.6\$\^\{+3.6\}\_\{-1.8\}\textbackslash backslashtimes\$ solar and a rock-to-ice ratio greater than 2/3. Lastly, we discuss the rich future potential for measuring refractory-to-volatile ratios in ultra-hot Jupiters with the arrival of JWST and by combining observations at low- and high-resolution.},

Previous explanations have included scattering, photochemistry, escaping metals, and disequilibrium chemistry. In this Letter, we show that slopes and features shortward of 0.5 microns can be caused by opacity not commonly considered in atmosphere models of exoplanets but guaranteed to be present if conditions are near chemical equilibrium including Fe I, Fe II, Ti I, Ni I, Ca I, Ca II, and SiO. Even relatively trace species (e.g., Cr I and Mn I) can contribute through strong lines in the UV and blue-optical. Using the PHOENIX atmosphere model, we describe how the short-wavelength transit spectrum varies with equilibrium temperature between 1000 K and 4000 K, as well as the effect that the rainout of condensates has at these wavelengths. We define two spectral indices to quantify the strength of the NUV and blue absorption compared to that in the red-optical, finding that the NUV transit depth will significantly exceed the transit depth from Rayleigh scattering alone for all hot Jupiters down to around 1000 K. In the blue-optical, hot Jupiters warmer than 2000 K will have transit depths larger than that from Rayleigh scattering, but below 2000 K, Rayleigh scattering can dominate, if present. We further show that these spectral indices may be used to trace the effects of rainout. We then compare our simulated transit spectra to existing observations of WASP-12b, WASP-33b, WASP-76b, and WASP-121b.},

Using a geometrical algorithm, the code solves exactly the area of sections of the disc of the planet that are occulted by the star. The code is written in C with a user-friendly Python interface, and is optimized to run quickly, with no loss in numerical precision. Approximately 1000 models can be generated per second in typical use, making Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses practicable. The modular nature of the code allows easy comparison of the effect of multiple different brightness distributions for the data set. As a test case, we apply the code to archival data on the phase curve of WASP-43b using a physically motivated analytical model for the two-dimensional brightness map. The model provides a good fit to the data; however, it overpredicts the temperature of the nightside. We speculate that this could be due to the presence of clouds on the nightside of the planet, or additional reflected light from the dayside. When testing a simple cloud model, we find that the best-fitting model has a geometric albedo of 0.32 {$\pm$} 0.02 and does not require a hot nightside. We also test for variation of the map parameters as a function of wavelength and find no statistically significant correlations.

If the cause was photoevaporation, the radius gap should trend with proxies for the early-life high-energy emission of planet-hosting stars. If, alternatively, the cause was core-powered mass loss, no such trends should exist. Critically, spurious trends between the radius gap and stellar properties arise from an underlying correlation with instellation. After accounting for this underlying correlation, we find no trends remain between the radius gap and stellar mass or present-day stellar activity as measured by near-UV emission. We dismiss the nondetection of a radius gap trend with near-UV emission because present-day near-UV emission is unlikely to trace early-life high-energy emission, but we provide a catalog of GALEX near-UV and far-UV emission measurements for general use. We interpret the nondetection of a radius gap trend with stellar mass by simulating photoevaporation with mass-dependent evolution of stellar high-energy emission. The simulation produces an undetectable trend between the radius gap and stellar mass under realistic sources of error. We conclude that no evidence, from this analysis or others in the literature, currently exists that clearly favors either photoevaporation or core powered mass loss as the primary cause of the exoplanet radius gap.

In this paper, we use a statistical analysis to determine the characteristic maximum (threshold) radii for various compositions for exoplanets with masses up to 25 Earth masses (M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$). We confirm that most planets with radii larger than 1.6 Earth radius (R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$) are not rocky, and must consist of lighter elements, as found by previous studies. We find that planets with radii above 2.6 R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ cannot be pure-water worlds, and must contain significant amounts of hydrogen and helium (H-He). We find that planets with radii larger than about 3 R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, 3.6 R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, and 4.3 R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ are expected to consist of 2\%, 5\% and 10\% of H-He, respectively. We investigate the sensitivity of the results to the assumed internal structure, the planetary temperature and albedo, and the accuracy of the mass and radius determination. We show that the envelope's metallicity, the percentage of H-He and the distribution of the elements play a significant role in the determination of the threshold radius. Finally, we conclude that despite the degenerate nature of the problem, it is possible to put limits on the possible range of compositions for planets with well-measured mass and radius.},

We argue that this high efficiency of planet formation favors planetesimal accretion over pebble accretion as the origin of the small planets observed by Kepler around late-type dwarf stars.},

  abstract = {Barnard's star is among the most studied stars given its proximity to the Sun. It is often considered \$the\$ Radial Velocity (RV) standard for fully convective stars due to its RV stability and equatorial declination. Recently, an \$M \textbackslash backslashsin i = 3.3 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ super-Earth planet candidate with a 233 day orbital period was announced by Ribas et al. (2018). New observations from the near-infrared Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) Doppler spectrometer do not show this planetary signal. We ran a suite of experiments on both the original data and a combined original + HPF data set. These experiments include model comparisons, periodogram analyses, and sampling sensitivity, all of which show the signal at the proposed period of 233 days is transitory in nature. The power in the signal is largely contained within 211 RVs that were taken within a 1000 day span of observing. Our preferred model of the system is one which features stellar activity without a planet. We propose that the candidate planetary signal is an alias of the 145 day rotation period. This result highlights the challenge of analyzing long-term, quasi-periodic activity signals over multi-year and multi-instrument observing campaigns.},

  abstract = {Observations and simulations of superhump phenomena in close binary star systems and observations and previous studies of eccentric planetary rings, such as the rings of Uranus, indicate that eccentric instabilities occur in disks and rings. We investigate the eccentric stability of a fluid disk or ring in the presence of the tidal field of a companion object which is in circular orbit. The disk can have pressure, viscosity, and self-gravity. Eccentric Lindblad resonances that lie within a disk cause eccentricity growth by the following process. For a particular perturbing potential component {$\phi$}m(r) cos [m(\$\th eta\$ - \$\O mega\$pt)] a simple tidal response is felt by the disk that scales with {$\phi$}m. This response couples with the imposed eccentricity to launch density waves at each eccentric Lindblad resonance, producing a response that scales with e{$\phi$}m. The coupling of these two responses produces a stress that increases eccentricity with growth rate that scales as {$\phi$}m2. We consider an eccentric disk with slowly varying orbital elements. An upper limit to the growth rate is obtained in the ideal case that eccentricity growth proceeds with minimal dissipation. In that case, for a narrow ring, mechanical energy changes \.E due to an eccentric Lindblad resonance for potential {$\phi$}m are related to angular momentum changes {\.J} by \.E = \$\O mega\$e{\.J}, where \$\O mega\$e = m\$\O mega\$p/(m {$\mp$} 1) is the pattern speed of the resonance, with the minus (plus) sign applying to an eccentric inner (outer) Lindblad resonance. For m \textbackslash textgreater 1, the ideal eccentricity growth rate {$\lambda$} is related to resonant angular momentum change as {$\lambda$} = [1/(m {$\mp$} 1)](|{\.J}\$\textbackslash backslash\$/e2J). For high m, these results apply to the eccentric planetary rings. For application to superhump phenomena, the m = 3 eccentric inner Lindblad resonance likely dominates over other eccentric Lindblad and eccentric corotational resonances. This resonance produces an ideal eccentricity growth rate in the disk {$\lambda$} = 2.08C\$\O mega\$pq2rres/max (ro - ri, w), where C is a function of the disk structure that is equal to unity for a narrow ring, q {$\ll$} 1 is the binary mass ratio, w is the resonance width, and rres, ri, and ro are the resonant, inner, and outer radii of the disk. A tightly wrapped, trailing, inwardly propagating acoustic wave is launched at this resonance with periodicity in 2\$\th eta\$ - 3\$\O mega\$pt.},

These are events during which a planet occults the disk of another planet in the same system, imparting a small photometric signal as its thermal or reflected light is blocked. We focus on the planets in TRAPPIST-1, whose orbital planes we show are aligned to within 0.3 degrees at 90\% confidence. We present a photodynamical model for predicting and computing PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 and other systems for various assumptions of the planets' atmospheric states. When marginalizing over the uncertainties on all orbital parameters, we find that the rate of PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 is about 1.4 per day. We investigate the prospects for detection of these events with the James Webb Space Telescope, finding that {$\sim$}10-20 occultations per year of b and c should be above the noise level at 12-15 microns. Joint modeling of several of these PPOs could lead to a robust detection. Alternatively, observations with the proposed Origins Space Telescope should be able to detect individual PPOs at high signal-to-noise. We show how PPOs can be used to break transit timing variation degeneracies, imposing strong constraints on the eccentricities and masses of the planets, as well as to constrain the longitudes of nodes and thus the complete three-dimensional structure of the system. We further show how modeling of these events can be used to reveal a planet's day/night temperature contrast and construct crude surface maps. We make our photodynamical code available on github.},

The data from this redesigned mission present a specific challenge; the targets systematically drift in position on an {$\sim$}6 hr timescale, inducing a significant instrumental signal in the photometric time series - this greatly impacts the ability to detect planetary signals and perform asteroseismic analysis. Here we detail our version of a reduction pipeline for K2 target pixel data, which automaticallydefines masks for all targets in a given frame; extracts the target's fluxand position time series; corrects the time series based on the apparent movement on the CCD (either in 1D or 2D), combined with the correction of instrumental and/or planetary signals via the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (KASOC) filter, thus rendering the time series ready for asteroseismic analysis; computes power spectra for all targets;and identifies potential contaminations between targets. From a test of our pipeline on a sample of targets from the K2 campaign 0, the recovery of data for multiple targets increases the amount of potential light curves by a factor of . Our pipeline could be applied to the upcoming TESS and PLATO 2.0 missions.},

The discovery is based on the analysis of CARMENES radial velocity (RV) observations in the visual channel as part of its survey for exoplanets around M dwarfs. In the case of GJ 1265, CARMENES observations were complemented with publicly available Doppler measurements from HARPS. The datasets reveal two planetary companions, one for each star, that share very similar properties: minimum masses of 8.0 {$\pm$} 0.5 M and 7.4 {$\pm$} 0.5 M in low-eccentricity orbits with periods of 3.023 {$\pm$} 0.001 d and 3.651 {$\pm$} 0.001 d for GJ 3779 b and GJ 1265 b, respectively. The periodic signals around 3 d found in the RV data have no counterpart in any spectral activity indicator. Furthermore, we collected available photometric data for the two host stars, which confirm that the additional Doppler variations found at periods of approximately 95 d can be attributed to the rotation of the stars. The addition of these planets to a mass-period diagram of known planets around M dwarfs suggests a bimodal distribution with a lack of short-period low-mass planets in the range of 2-5 M . It also indicates that super-Earths (\textbackslash textgreater5 M ) currently detected by RV and transit techniques around M stars are usually found in systems dominated by a single planet.},

We assume that the angular momentum excess of a proto-star is initially concentrated onto one-third of the total mass which forms a disc orbiting the new-born star. Viscous dissipation in this disc will cause it to shine with a luminosity greater than the final main sequence star for a period of 105 yr or so. Most of the properties of T Tauri stars can be explained as a consequence of disc evolution. Flares in Flare stars are interpreted as the entry of blobs of an old disc into the late type stellar atmospheres. On this hypothesis flaring activity could be observed in M stars of up to 5 x 108 yr old, and planetary systems will be common.

This feature appears in examining the distribution of planetary radii, but has only ever been characterized on small samples. The valley could be a result of photoevaporation, which has been predicted in numerous theoretical models, or a result of other processes. Here, we investigate the relationship between planetary radius and orbital period through 2-dimensional kernel density estimator and various clustering methods, using all known super-Earths (\$R\textbackslash textless4.0R\_E\$). With our larger sample, we confirm the radius valley and characterize it as a power law. Using a variety of methods, we find a range of slopes that are consistent with each other and distinctly negative. We average over these results and find the slope to be \$m=-0.319\^\{+0.088\}\_\{-0.116\}\$. We repeat our analysis on samples from previous studies. For all methods we use, the resulting line has a negative slope, which is consistent with models of photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss but inconsistent with planets forming in a gas-poor disk.},

  abstract = {Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes exhibit great diversity in their compositional and orbital properties. Their bulk densities span a large range, from those dense enough to be purely rocky to those needing a substantial contribution from volatiles to their volumes. Their orbital configurations range from compact, circular multi-transiting systems like Kepler-11 to systems like our Solar System's terrestrial planets with wider spacings and modest but significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Here we investigate whether a continuum of formation conditions resulting from variation in the amount of solids available in the inner disk can account for the diversity of orbital and compositional properties observed for super Earths, including the apparent dichotomy between single transiting and multiple transiting system. We simulate in situ formation of super-Earths via giant impacts and compare to the observed Kepler sample. We find that intrinsic variations among disks in the amount of solids available for in situ formation can account for the orbital and compositional diversity observed among Kepler's transiting planets. Our simulations can account for the planets' distributions of orbital period ratios, transit duration ratios, and transit multiplicity; higher eccentricities for single than multi transiting planets; smaller eccentricities for larger planets; scatter in the mass-radius relation, including lower densities for planets with masses measured with TTVs than RVs; and similarity in planets' sizes and spacings within each system. Our findings support the theory that variation among super-Earth and mini-Neptune properties is primarily locked in by different in situ formation conditions, rather than arising stochastically through subsequent evolution.},

  abstract = {Directly detecting thermal emission from young extrasolar planets allows measurement of their atmospheric compositions and luminosities, which are influenced by their formation mechanisms. Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we discovered a planet orbiting the {$\sim$}20-million-year-old star 51 Eridani at a projected separation of 13 astronomical units. Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with strong methane and water-vapor absorption. Modeling of the spectra and photometry yields a luminosity (normalized by the luminosity of the Sun) of 1.6 to 4.0 \texttimes{} 10-6 and an effective temperature of 600 to 750 kelvin. For this age and luminosity, "hot-start" formation models indicate a mass twice that of Jupiter. This planet also has a sufficiently low luminosity to be consistent with the "cold-start" core-accretion process that may have formed Jupiter.},

  abstract = {Most of our current knowledge on planet formation is still based on the analysis of main-sequence, solar-type stars. Conversely, detailed chemical studies of large samples of M-dwarf planet hosts are still missing. We develop for the first time a methodology to determine stellar abundances of elements others than iron for M dwarf stars from high-resolution, optical spectra. Our methodology is based on the use of principal component analysis and sparse Bayesian's methods. We made use of a set of M dwarfs orbiting around an FGK primary with known abundances to train our methods. We applied our methods to derive stellar metalliticies and abundances of a large sample of M dwarfs observed within the framework of current radial velocity surveys. We then used a sample of nearby FGK stars to cross-validate our technique by comparing the derived abundance trends in the M dwarf sample with those found on the FGK stars. The metallicity distribution of the different subsamples shows that M dwarfs hosting giant planets show a planet-metallicity correlation as well as a correlation with the stellar mass. M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets do not seem to follow the planet-metallicity correlation. We also found that the frequency of low-mass planets does not depend on the mass of the stellar host. These results seem in agreement with previous works. However, we note that for giant planet hosts our metallicities predict a weaker planet metallicity correlation but a stronger mass-dependency than photometric values. We show, for the first time, that there seems to be no differences in the abundance distribution of elements different from iron between M dwarfs with and without known planets. Our data shows that low-mass stars with planets follow the same metallicity, mass, and abundance trends than their FGK counterparts.},

  abstract = {The statistical properties of circumstellar disks around young stars are important for constraining theoretical models for the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. In this brief review, I survey the literature related to ground-based and Spitzer-based infrared (IR) studies of young stellar clusters, with particular emphasis on tracing the evolution of primordial (``protoplanetary'') disks through spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. The available data demonstrate that the fraction of young stars with optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopic evidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decay with characteristic time {$\sim$}2.5 Myr (half-life = 1.7 Myr). Large IR surveys of {$\sim$}2-5 Myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatter in the observed disk fractions as a function of age. Recent Spitzer surveys have found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass and environment (binarity, proximity to massive stars, and cluster density). Perhaps most significantly for understanding the planeticity of stars, the disk fraction decay timescale appears to vary by stellar mass, ranging from {$\sim$}1 Myr for \textbackslash textgreater1.3 Msun stars to {$\sim$}3 Myr for \textbackslash textless0.08 Msun brown dwarfs. The exponential decay function may provide a useful empirical formalism for estimating very rough ages for YSO populations and for modeling the effects of disk-locking on the angular momentum of young stars.},

  abstract = {A relation between the mass accretion rate onto the central young star and the mass of the surrounding protoplanetary disk has long been theoretically predicted and observationally sought. For the first time, we have accurately and homogeneously determined the photospheric parameters, mass accretion rate, and disk mass for an essentially complete sample of young stars with disks in the Lupus clouds. Our work combines the results of surveys conducted with VLT/X-Shooter and ALMA. With this dataset we are able to test a basic prediction of viscous accretion theory, the existence of a linear relation between the mass accretion rate onto the central star and the total disk mass. We find a correlation between the mass accretion rate and the disk dust mass, with a ratio that is roughly consistent with the expected viscous timescale when assuming an interstellar medium (ISM) gas-to-dust ratio. This confirms that mass accretion rates are related to the properties of the outer disk. We find no correlation between mass accretion rates and the disk mass measured by CO isotopologues emission lines, possibly owing to the small number of measured disk gas masses. This suggests that the mm-sized dust mass better traces the total disk mass and that masses derived from CO may be underestimated, at least in some cases.},

  abstract = {When and how planets form in protoplanetary disks is still a topic of discussion. Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that are leading to new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence on stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in {$\sim$}1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. We recalculated the disk masses using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low-mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found by converting the measured planet masses into heavy element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (\textbackslash textless0.1-1 Myr) and a large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished by fresh planet-forming material from the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are replenished by their surroundings.},

Current planet population synthesis models, which aim to describe the planet formation process from the protoplanetary disk phase to the time exoplanets are observed, rely on prescriptions for the underlying properties of protoplanetary disks where planets form and evolve. The recent development in measuring disk masses and disk-star interaction properties, i.e., mass accretion rates, in large samples of young stellar objects demand a more careful comparison between the models and the data. We performed an initial critical assessment of the assumptions made by planet synthesis population models by looking at the relation between mass accretion rates and disk masses in the models and in the currently available data. We find that the currently used disk models predict mass accretion rate in line with what is measured, but with a much lower spread of values than observed. This difference is mainly because the models have a smaller spread of viscous timescales than what is needed to reproduce the observations. We also find an overabundance of weakly accreting disks in the models where giant planets have formed with respect to observations of typical disks. We suggest that either fewer giant planets have formed in reality or that the prescription for planet accretion predicts accretion on the planets that is too high. Finally, the comparison of the properties of transition disks with large cavities confirms that in many of these objects the observed accretion rates are higher than those predicted by the models. On the other hand, PDS70, a transition disk with two detected giant planets in the cavity, shows mass accretion rates well in line with model predictions.},

For this work, we measured the mass accretion rate for young stellar objects with disks at age \textbackslash textgreater 5 Myr, a critical test for the current models of disk evolution. We present the analysis of the spectra of 36 targets in the {$\sim$}5\textendash 10 Myr old Upper Scorpius star-forming region for which disk masses were measured with ALMA. We find that the mass accretion rates in this sample of old but still surviving disks are similarly high as those of the younger ({$\sim$}1-3 Myr old) star-forming regions of Lupus and Chamaeleon I, when considering the dependence on stellar and disk mass. In particular, several disks show high mass accretion rates {$\greaterequivlnt$}10 -9 M {$\odot$} yr -1 while having low disk masses. Furthermore, the median values of the measured mass accretion rates in the disk mass ranges where our sample is complete at a level {$\sim$}60-80\% are compatible in these three regions. At the same time, the spread of mass accretion rates at any given disk mass is still \textbackslash textgreater 0.9 dex, even at age \textbackslash textgreater 5 Myr. These results are in contrast with simple models of viscous evolution, which would predict that the values of the mass accretion rate diminish with time, and a tighter correlation with disk mass at age \textbackslash textgreater 5 Myr. Similarly, simple models of internal photoevaporation cannot reproduce the observed mass accretion rates, while external photoevaporation might explain the low disk masses and high accretion rates. A possible partial solution to the discrepancy with the viscous models is that the gas-to-dust ratio of the disks at {$\sim$}5\textendash 10 Myr is significantly different and higher than the canonical 100, as suggested by some dust and gas disk evolution models. The results shown here require the presence of several interplaying processes, such as detailed dust evolution, external photoevaporation, and possibly MHD winds, to explain the secular evolution of protoplanetary disks.},

These gravity data are inherently mostly sensitive to a planet's outer regions, providing only loose constraints on the deep interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. This fundamental limitation stymies efforts to measure the mass and compactness of these planets' cores, crucial properties for understanding their formation pathways and evolution. However, studies of Saturn's rings have revealed waves driven by pulsation modes within Saturn, offering independent seismic probes of Saturn's interior. The observations reveal gravity mode (g mode) pulsations which indicate that a part of Saturn's interior is stably stratified by composition gradients, and the g mode frequencies directly probe the buoyancy frequency within the planet. Here, we compare structural models with gravity and seismic measurements to show that the data can only be explained by a diffuse, stably stratified core-envelope transition region in Saturn extending to approximately 60\% of the planet's radius and containing approximately 17 Earth masses of ice and rock. The gradual distribution of heavy elements constrains mixing processes at work in Saturn, and it may reflect the planet's primordial structure and accretion history.},

  abstract = {Context. Solar and extrasolar comets and extrasolar planets are the subject of numerous studies in order to determine their chemical composition and internal structure. In the case of planetesimals, their compositions are important as they govern in part the composition of future planets. Aims. The present works aims at determining the chemical composition of icy planetesimals, believed to be similar to present day comets, formed in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. The main objective of this work is to provide valuable theoretical data on chemical composition for models of planetesimals and comets, and models of planet formation and evolution. Methods. We have developed a model that calculates the composition of ices formed during the cooling of the stellar nebula. Coupled with a model of refractory element formation, it allows us to determine the chemical composition and mass ratio of ices to rocks in icy planetesimals throughout in the protoplanetary disc. Results. We provide relationships for ice line positions (for different volatile species) in the disc, and chemical compositions and mass ratios of ice relative to rock for icy planetesimals in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. From an initial homogeneous composition of the nebula, a wide variety of chemical compositions of planetesimals were produced as a function of the mass of the disc and distance to the star. Ices incorporated in planetesimals are mainly composed of H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and NH3. The ice/rock mass ratio is equal to 1 0.5 in icy planetesimals following assumptions. This last value is in good agreement with observations of solar system comets, but remains lower than usual assumptions made in planet formation models, taking this ratio to be of 2-3.},

  abstract = {Context. Solar and extrasolar planets are the subject of numerous studies aiming to determine their chemical composition and internal structure. In the case of extrasolar planets, the composition is important as it partly governs their potential habitability. Moreover, observational determination of chemical composition of planetary atmospheres are becoming available, especially for transiting planets. Aims. The present works aims at determining the chemical composition of planets formed in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. The main objective of this work is to provide valuable theoretical data for models of planet formation and evolution, and future interpretation of chemical composition of solar and extrasolar planets. Methods. We have developed a model that computes the composition of ices in planets in different stellar systems with the use of models of ice and planetary formation. Results. We provide the chemical composition, ice/rock mass ratio and C:O molar ratio for planets in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. From an initial homogeneous composition of the nebula, we produce a wide variety of planetary chemical compositions as a function of the mass of the disk and distance to the star. The volatile species incorporated in planets are mainly composed of H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and NH3. Icy or ocean planets have systematically higher values of molecular abundances compared to giant and rocky planets. Gas giant planets are depleted in highly volatile molecules such as CH4, CO, and N2 compared to icy or ocean planets. The ice/rock mass ratio in icy or ocean and gas giant planets is, respectively, equal at maximum to 1.01 {$\pm$} 0.33 and 0.8 {$\pm$} 0.5, and is different from the usual assumptions made in planet formation models, which suggested this ratio to be 2-3. The C:O molar ratio in the atmosphere of gas giant planets is depleted by at least 30\% compared to solar value.},

The orbital fit implies that the companion has a mass of M=2.1 M\_JUP/sini, an orbital eccentricity of e=0.27+/-0.03, and a semimajor axis of a=0.21 AU. The planet is the first found around an M dwarf and was drawn from a survey of 24 such stars at Lick Observatory. It is the closest extrasolar planet yet found, providing opportunities for follow-up detection. The presence of a giant planet on a noncircular orbit, 0.2 AU from a 0.32 M\_solar star, presents a challenge to planet formation theory. This planet detection around an M dwarf suggests that giant planets are numerous in the Galaxy.

The orbital fit yields companion masses of Msini=0.56 and 1.89 MJ, orbital periods of P=30.1 and 61.0 days, semimajor axes of a=0.13 and 0.21 AU, and eccentricities of e=0.28 and 0.10, respectively. The orbital periods are nearly in the ratio of 2:1, unprecedented among major planets but common among moons and asteroids. Moreover, the axes of the elliptical orbits appear to be nearly aligned. The inner companion was not recognized previously owing to the 2:1 ratio of periods, which allowed its signature to masquerade as added orbital eccentricity of the outer planet. Dynamical simulations show that the system is stable within a subset of the observed orbital parameters. The stability may be provided by a mean-motion resonance and the apparent alignment of the major axes. These planets pose unsolved questions about their formation and dynamical evolution, which brought them within 0.08 AU of each other and locked them in resonance.

  abstract = {The presence of CO gas around 10-50 Myr old A stars with debris discs has sparked debate on whether the gas is primordial or secondary. Since secondary gas released from planetesimals is poor in H\$\_2\$, it was thought that CO would quickly photodissociate never reaching the high levels observed around the majority of A stars with bright debris discs. Kral et al. 2019 showed that neutral carbon produced by CO photodissociation can effectively shield CO and potentially explain the high CO masses around 9 A stars with bright debris discs. Here we present a new model that simulates the gas viscous evolution, accounting for carbon shielding and how the gas release rate decreases with time as the planetesimal disc loses mass. We find that the present gas mass in a system is highly dependant on its evolutionary path. Since gas is lost on long timescales, it can retain a memory of the initial disc mass. Moreover, we find that gas levels can be out of equilibrium and quickly evolving from a shielded onto an unshielded state. With this model, we build the first population synthesis of gas around A stars, which we use to constrain the disc viscosity. We find a good match with a high viscosity (\$\textbackslash backslashalpha\textbackslash backslashsim0.1\$), indicating that gas is lost on timescales \$\textbackslash backslashsim1-10\$ Myr. Moreover, our model also shows that high CO masses are not expected around FGK stars since their planetesimal discs are born with lower masses, explaining why shielded discs are only found around A stars. Finally, we hypothesise that the observed carbon cavities could be due to radiation pressure or accreting planets.},

  abstract = {The dust production in debris discs by grinding collisions of planetesimals requires their orbits to be stirred. However, stirring levels remain largely unconstrained, and consequently the stirring mechanisms as well. This work shows how the sharpness of the outer edge of discs can be used to constrain the stirring levels. Namely, the sharper the edge is the lower the eccentricity dispersion must be. For a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities (e), I find that the disc surface density near the outer edge can be parametrised as tanh [(rmax - r)/lout], where rmax approximates the maximum semi-major axis and lout defines the edge smoothness. If the semi-major axis distribution has sharp edges erms is roughly 1.2lout/rmax , or erms = 0.77lout/rmax if semi-major axes have diffused due to self-stirring. This model is fitted to ALMA data of five wide discs: HD 107146, HD 92945, HD 206893, AU Mic and HR 8799. The results show that HD 107146, HD 92945 and AU Mic have the sharpest outer edges, corresponding to erms values of 0.121 {$\pm$} 0.05, \$0.15\^\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.05\}\$ and 0.10 {$\pm$} 0.02 if their discs are self-stirred, suggesting the presence of Pluto-sized objects embedded in the disc. Although these stirring values are larger than typically assumed, the radial stirring of HD 92945 is in good agreement with its vertical stirring constrained by the disc height. HD 206893 and HR 8799, on the other hand, have smooth outer edges that are indicative of scattered discs since both systems have massive inner companions.},

High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets.

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The ability to generate physically plausible ensembles of variable sources is critical to the optimization of time-domain survey cadences and the training of classification models on datasets with few to no labels. Traditional data augmentation techniques expand training sets by reenvisioning observed exemplars, seeking to simulate observations of specific training sources under different (exogenous) conditions. Unlike fully theory-driven models, these approaches do not typically allow principled interpolation nor extrapolation. Moreover, the principal drawback of theory-driven models lies in the prohibitive computational cost of simulating source observables from \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it ab initio\} parameters. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable machine learning approach to generate realistic light curves of periodic variables capable of integrating physical parameters and variability classes as inputs. Our deep generative model, inspired by the Transparent Latent Space Generative Adversarial Networks (TL-GANs), uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture with Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) layers, trained using the \$\textbackslash backslash\$hbox\{OGLE-III\} optical light curves and physical characteristics (e.g., effective temperature and absolute magnitude) from Gaia DR2. A test using the temperature-shape relationship of RR\$\textbackslash backslash\$,Lyrae demonstrates the efficacy of our generative "Physics-Enhanced Latent Space VAE" (PELS-VAE) model. Such deep generative models, serving as non-linear non-parametric emulators, present a novel tool for astronomers to create synthetic time series over arbitrary cadences.},

  abstract = {M dwarfs host most of the exoplanets in the local Milky Way. Some of these planets, ranging from sub-Earths to super-Jupiters, orbit in their stars' habitable zones, although many likely possess surface environments that preclude habitability. Moreover, exomoons around these planets could harbor life for long timescales and thus may also be targets for biosignature surveys. Here we investigate the potential habitability, stability, and detectability of exomoons around exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs. We first compile an updated list of known M-dwarf exoplanet hosts, comprising 109 stars and 205 planets. For each M dwarf, we compute and update precise luminosities with the Virtual Observatory SED Analyzer and Gaia DR2 parallaxes to determine inner and outer boundaries of their habitable zones. For each planet, we retrieve (or, when necessary, homogeneously estimate) their masses and radii, calculate the long-term dynamical stability of hypothetical moons, and identify those planets that can support habitable moons. We find that 33 exoplanet candidates are located in the habitable zones of their host stars and that four of them could host Moon- to Titan-mass exomoons for timescales longer than the Hubble time.},

The spectroscopic analysis was based on a carefully selected set of Fe I and Fe II lines, resulting in precise values for the stellar parameters of effective temperature (T\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm eff\}\$) and surface gravity (log \$g\$). Combining the stellar parameters with \$Gaia\$ DR2 parallaxes and precise distances, we derived both stellar and planetary radii for our sample, with a median internal uncertainty of 2.8\$\textbackslash backslash\%\$ in the stellar radii and 3.7\$\textbackslash backslash\%\$ in the planetary radii. An investigation into the distribution of planetary radii confirmed the bimodal nature of this distribution for the small radius planets found in previous studies, with peaks at: \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$1.47 \$\textbackslash backslashpm\$ 0.05 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$2.72 \$\textbackslash backslashpm\$ 0.10 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$, with a gap at \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$ 1.9R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. Previous studies that modeled planetary formation that is dominated by photo-evaporation predicted this bimodal radii distribution and the presence of a radius gap, or photo-evaporation valley. Our results are in overall agreement with these models. The high internal precision achieved here in the derived planetary radii clearly reveal the presence of a slope in the photo-evaporation valley for the CKS sample, indicating that the position of the radius gap decreases with orbital period; this decrease was fit by a power law of the form R\$\_\{pl\}\$ \$\textbackslash backslashpropto\$ P\$\^\{-0.11\}\$, which is consistent with photo-evaporation and Earth-like core composition models of planet formation.},

  abstract = {AU Mic is a young, active star around which a transiting planet has been recently detected. Here we report an analysis of its TESS light curve where we model the quasi-periodic rotational modulation by starspots simultaneously to the flaring activity and planetary transits. We measured a flare occurrence rate of 6.35 flares-per-day for flares with amplitudes in the range \$0.06\textbackslash backslash\% \textbackslash textless f\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm max\} \textbackslash textless 1.5\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the star flux. We employ a Bayesian MCMC analysis to model the five transits of AU Mic b observed by TESS, improving the constraints on the planetary parameters. The measured planet-to-star radius ratio of \$0.05345\^\{+0.00014\}\_\{-0.00015\}\$ implies a physical radius of \$4.38\textbackslash backslashpm0.18\$ M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ and a planet density of \$1.1\textbackslash backslashpm0.3\$ g\$\textbackslash backslash\$,cm\$\^\{-3\}\$, confirming that AU Mic b is a Neptune-size moderately inflated planet. Whereas a single feature possibly due to a second planet was previously reported in the former TESS data, we report the detection of two additional transit-like events in the new TESS observations of July 2020. This represents substantial evidence for a second planet (AU Mic c) in the system. We analyzed its three available transits and obtained an orbital period of \$18.858991\textbackslash backslashpm0.000010\$ d and a planetary radius of \$3.51\textbackslash backslashpm0.16\$ R\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, which defines AU Mic c as a warm Neptune-size planet with an expected mass in the range 1.7 M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus \textbackslash textless M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm c\} \textbackslash textless 27.7\$ M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. The two planets in the AU Mic system are in near 9:4 mean-motion resonance. We show that this configuration is dynamically stable and should produce TTV. Our non-detection of significant TTV in AU Mic b suggests an upper limit to the mass of AU Mic c of \$\textbackslash textless7\$ M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. Being a young multi-planet system with at least two transiting planets, AU Mic becomes a key system for the study of atmospheres of infant planets as well as of planet-planet and planet-disk dynamics at the early stages of planetary evolution.},

Two effects arise, namely a squared mass-weighted torque imbalance and an increased mass flow through the overlapping gaps from the outer disc to the inner disc, which both play in favour of an outwards migration. Indeed, under the conditions presented here, which describe the evolution of a pair of protoplanets respectively Jupiter-and Saturn-sized, the migration is reversed, while the semimajor axis ratio of the planets is constant and the eccentricities are confined to small values by the disc material The long-term behaviour of the system is briefly discussed, and could account for the high eccentricities observed for the extrasolar planets with semimajor axis a \textbackslash textgreater 0.2 au.},

This system consists of two confirmed transiting planets, Kepler-51b (Pb = 45.2 days) and Kepler-51c (P c= 85.3 days), and one transiting planet candidate KOI-620.02 (P 02= 130.2 days), which lie close to a 1: 2: 3 resonance chain. Our analysis shows that their TTVs are consistently explained by the three-planet model, and constrains their masses as (Kepler-51b), M c= 4.0 {$\pm$} 0.4 M {$\oplus$} (Kepler-51c), and M 02= 7.6 {$\pm$} 1.1 M {$\oplus$} (KOI-620.02), thus confirming KOI-620.02 as a planet in this system.

Combining these estimates, we find that all three planets in this system have densities among the lowest determined, {$\rho$}p{$\lessequivlnt$} 0.05 g cm-3. With this feature, the Kepler-51 system serves as another example of low-density compact multi-transiting planetary systems. We also identify a curious feature in the archived Kepler light curve during the double transit of Kepler-51b and KOI-620.02, which could be explained by their overlapping on the stellar disk (a planet-planet eclipse). If this is really the case, the sky-plane inclination of KOI-620.02's orbit relative to that of Kepler-51b is given by , implying significant misalignment of their orbital planes. This interpretation, however, seems unlikely because such an event that is consistent with all of the observations is found to be exceedingly rare. \textcopyright{} 2014.

  abstract = {Previous analyses of Doppler and Kepler data have found that Sun-like stars hosting "cold Jupiters" (giant planets with \$a\textbackslash backslashgtrsim 1\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{AU\}\$) almost always host "inner super-Earths" (1-\$4\textbackslash backslash,R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, \$a\textbackslash backslashlesssim1\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{AU\}\$). Here, we attempt to determine the degree of alignment between the orbital planes of the cold Jupiters and the inner super-Earths. The key observational input is the fraction of Kepler stars with transiting super-Earths that also have transiting cold Jupiters. This fraction depends on both the probability for cold Jupiters to occur in such systems, and on the mutual orbital inclinations. Since the probability of occurrence has already been measured in Doppler surveys, we can use the data to constrain the dispersion of the mutual inclination distribution. We find \$\textbackslash backslashsigma=11.8\^\{+12.7\}\_\{-5.5\}\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (68\% confidence) and \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\textbackslash textgreater3.5\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$ (95\% confidence), where \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ is the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distribution. This suggests that planetary orbits in systems with cold Jupiters tend to be coplanar - although not quite as coplanar as those in the Solar System, which have a mean inclination from the invariable plane of \$1.8\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{deg\}\$. We also find evidence that cold Jupiters have lower mutual inclinations relative to inner systems with higher transit multiplicity. This suggests a link between the dynamical excitation in the inner and outer systems. For example, perturbations from misaligned cold Jupiters may dynamically heat or destabilize systems of inner super-Earths.},

We interpret this feature in terms of high-eccentricity migration of planets that arrive in the vicinity of the Roche limit, where their orbits are tidally circularized, long after the dispersal of their natal disk. We demonstrate that the two distinct segments of the boundary are a direct consequence of the different slopes of the empirical mass\textendash radius relation for small and large planets, and show that this relation also fixes the mass coordinate of the intersection point. The period coordinate of this point, as well as the detailed shape of the lower boundary, can be reproduced with a plausible choice of a key parameter in the underlying migration model. The detailed shape of the upper boundary, on the other hand, is determined by the post-circularization tidal exchange of angular momentum with the star and can be reproduced with a stellar tidal quality factor \$Q\^\textbackslash backslashprime\_*\textbackslash backslashsim10\^6\$.},

  abstract = {Context. Planet formation with pebbles has been proposed to solve a couple of long-standing issues in the classical formation model. Some sophisticated simulations have been done to confirm the efficiency of pebble accretion. However, there has not been any global N-body simulations that compare the outcomes of planet formation via pebble accretion with observed extrasolar planetary systems. Aims. In this paper, we study the effects of a range of initial parameters of planet formation via pebble accretion, and present the first results of our simulations. Methods. We incorporate the pebble accretion model by Ida et al. (2016) in the N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al. 1998), along with the effects of gas accretion, eccentricity and inclination damping and planet migration in the disc. Results. We confirm that pebble accretion leads to a variety of planetary systems, but have difficulty in reproducing observed properties of exoplanetary systems, such as planetary mass, semimajor axis, and eccentricity distributions. The main reason behind this is a too-efficient type I migration, which sensitively depends on the disc model. However, our simulations also lead to a few interesting predictions. First, we find that formation efficiencies of planets depend on the stellar metallicities, not only for giant planets, but also for Earths (Es) and Super-Earths (SEs). The dependency for Es/SEs is subtle. Although higher metallicity environments lead to faster formation of a larger number of Es/SEs, they also tend to be lost later via dynamical instability. Second, our results indicate that a wide range of bulk densities observed for Es and SEs is a natural consequence of dynamical evolution of planetary systems. Third, the ejection trend of our simulations suggest that one free-floating E/SE may be expected for two smaller-mass planets.},

With observations planned until at least early 2018, K2 will continue to identify more planet candidates. We present here 275 planet candidates observed during Campaigns 0-10 of the K2 mission that are orbiting stars brighter than 13th magnitude (in Kepler band) and for which we have obtained high-resolution spectra (R = 44,000). These candidates are analyzed using the VESPA package (Morton 2012, 2015b) in order to calculate their false positive probabilities (FPP). We find that 149 candidates are validated with a FPP less than 0.1\%, 39 of which were previously only candidates and 56 of which were previously undetected. The processes of data reduction, candidate identification, and statistical validation are described, and the demographics of the candidates and newly validated planets are explored. We show tentative evidence of a gap in the planet radius distribution of our candidate sample. Comparing our sample to the Kepler candidate sample investigated by Fulton et al. (2017), we conclude that more planets are required to quantitatively confirm the gap with K2 candidates or validated planets. This work, in addition to increasing the population of validated K2 planets by roughly 50\% and providing new targets for follow-up observations, will also serve as a framework for validating candidates from upcoming K2 campaigns and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), expected to launch in 2018.},

HD 40307 is a K2 V metal-deficient star at a distance of only 13 parsec, which is part of the HARPS GTO high-precision planet-search programme. The three planets on circular orbits have very low minimum masses of 4.2, 6.9, and 9.2 Earth masses and periods of 4.3, 9.6, and 20.5 days, respectively. The planet with the shortest period is the lowest mass planet detected to-date orbiting a main sequence star. The detection of the correspondingly low amplitudes of the induced radial-velocity variations is secured completely by the 135 high-quality HARPS observations illustrated by the radial-velocity residuals around the 3-Keplerian solution of only 0.85 ms -1. Activity and bisector indicators exclude any significant perturbations of stellar intrinsic origin, which supports a planetary interpretation. In contrast to most planet-host stars, HD 40307 has a significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.31), which suggests that very light planets might have a different dependence on host star metallicity than gas giant planets. In addition to the 3 planets close to the central star, a small drift in the radial-velocity residuals implies the presence of another companion in the system, the nature of which is still unknown.},

The size of our star sample and the precision achieved with HARPS have allowed the detection of a sufficiently large number of low-mass planets to study the statistical properties of their orbital elements, the correlation of the host-star metallicity with the planet masses, as well as the occurrence rate of planetary systems around solar-type stars. A robust estimate of the frequency of systems shows that more than 50\% of solar-type stars harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up to 100 days. Different properties are observed for the population of planets less massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets (SEN) is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence rate does not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN planets belong to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of the SEN planets seems limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence rate of gaseous giant planets is growing with the logarithm of the period, and is strongly increasing with the host-star metallicity. About 14\% of solar-type stars have a planetary companion more massive than 50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than 10 years. Orbital eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and beyond. The precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to detect planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a significant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun vicinity is achieved by Doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered planets are announced in the Appendix of this paper, among which 15 Super-Earths.},

  abstract = {A few studies have reported a significant dearth of exoplanets with Neptune mass and radius with orbital periods below 2-4 d. This cannot be explained by observational biases because many Neptunian planets with longer orbital periods have been detected. The existence of this desert is similar to the appearance of the so-called brown-dwarf desert that suggests different formation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital periods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert might indicate different mechanisms of formation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. We here follow a previous study and examine the location and shape of the desert in both the period-mass and period-radius planes, using the currently available large samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively sharp upper edge, with a planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the planetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary is located along masses that are apparently linearly proportional to the period. The desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear. It seems as if the radius along the upper boundary is inversely proportional to the period to the power of one-third, while the lower boundary shows a radius that is proportional to the period to the power of two-thirds. The combination of the two upper bounds of the desert, in the period-mass and period-radius planes, yields a planetary mass-radius relation of Rp/RJup ? (1.2 {$\pm$} 0.3)(Mp/MJup)0.27 {$\pm$} 0.11 for 0.1 ? Mp/MJup ? 1. The derived shape of the desert, which might extend up to periods of 5-10 d, could shed some light on the formation and evolution of close-in planets.},

A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation-turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity-are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.

Pluto was the first body to be discovered in what is now known as the Kuiper belt, its orbit ultimately becoming a major clue that the giant planets underwent substantial orbital migration early in Solar System history. This migration has been linked to an early instability in the orbits of the giant planets and the formation of the Kuiper belt itself, from an ancestral trans-Neptunian planetesimal disk that included Pluto. Pluto-Charon is emblematic of what are now recognized as small or dwarf planets. Far from being a cold, dead, battered icy relic, Pluto displays evidence of a complex geological history, with ongoing processes including tectonism, cryovolcanism, solid-state convection, glacial flow, atmospheric circulation, surface-atmosphere volatile exchange, aeolian processes, and atmospheric photochemistry, microphysics, and haze formation. Despite Pluto's relatively modest scale, the combination of original accretional heat, long-term internal radiogenic heat release, and external solar forcing, when combined with sufficiently volatile (and thus mobile) materials, yields an active world. Pluto may have inherited a large organic mass fraction during accretion, which may responsible, in part, for its surface and atmospheric volatiles. Charon, Pluto's major moon, displays evidence of extensive early tectonism and cryovolcanism. Dwarf planets are thus truly planetary in terms of satellite systems and geological and atmospheric complexity (if not ongoing activity). What they may lack in mass is made up in number, and the majority of the Solar System's dwarf planets remain undiscovered.},

The corotation torque in an inviscid, isothermal, dead zone ought to saturate, with the libration region becoming both symmetrical and of a uniform vortensity, leading to fast inward migration driven by the Lindblad torques alone. However, in such a low viscosity situation, the material on librating streamlines essentially preserves its vortensity. If there is relative radial motion between the disc gas and the planet, the librating streamlines will no longer be symmetrical. Hence, if the gas is torqued by a large scale magnetic field so that it undergoes a net inflow or outflow past the planet, driving evolution of the vortensity and inducing asymmetry of the corotation region, the corotation torque can grow, leading to a positive torque. In this paper we treat this effect by applying a symmetry argument to the previously studied case of a migrating planet in an inviscid disc. Our results show that the corotation torque due to a laminar Hall-induced magnetic field in a dead zone behaves quite differently from that studied previously for a viscous disc. Furthermore, the magnetic field induced corotation torque and the dynamical corotation torque in a low viscosity disc can be regarded as one unified effect.},

We show that a wind-driven laminar accretion flow through the surface layers of the disc does not significantly modify the migration torque experienced by embedded planets. More importantly, we find that 3D effects lead to a dramatic change in the behaviour of the dynamical corotation torque compared to earlier 2D theory and simulations. Whereas it was previously shown that the dynamical corotation torque could act to slow and essentially stall the inward migration of a low mass planet, our results in 3D show that the dynamical corotation torque has the complete opposite effect and speeds up inward migration. Our numerical experiments implicate buoyancy resonances as the cause. These have two effects: (i) they exert a direct torque on the planet, whose magnitude relative to the Lindblad torque is measured in our simulations to be small; (ii) they torque the gas librating on horseshoe orbits in the corotation region and drive evolution of its vortensity, leading to the negative dynamical corotation torque. This indicates that at low turbulent viscosity, the detailed vertical thermal structure of the protoplanetary disc plays an important role in determining the migration behaviour of embedded planets. If this result holds up under more a refined treatment of disc thermal evolution, then it has important implications for understanding the formation and early evolution of planetary systems.},

  abstract = {There exists a positive correlation between orbital eccentricity and the average stellar flux that planets receive from their parent star. Often, though, it is assumed that the average equilibrium temperature would correspondingly increase with eccentricity. Here we test this assumption by calculating and comparing analytic solutions for both the spatial and temporal averages of orbital distance, stellar flux, and equilibrium temperature. Our solutions show that the average equilibrium temperature of a planet, with a constant albedo, slowly decreases with eccentricity until converging to a value 90\% that of a circular orbit. This might be the case for many types of planets (e.g., hot-jupiters); however, the actual equilibrium and surface temperature of planets also depend on orbital variations of albedo and greenhouse. Our results also have implications in understanding the climate, habitability and the occurrence of potential Earth-like planets. For instance, it helps explain why the limits of the habitable zone for planets in highly elliptical orbits are wider than expected from the mean flux approximation, as shown by climate models.},

The star faded in a manner similar to the long-term fading seen in Kepler data about 1400 days previously. The dimming rate for the entire period reported is 22.1 +\$\textbackslash backslash\$- 9.7 milli-mag/yr in the Swift wavebands, with amounts of 21.0 +\$\textbackslash backslash\$- 4.5 mmag in the groundbased B measurements, 14.0 +\$\textbackslash backslash\$- 4.5 mmag in V, and 13.0 +\$\textbackslash backslash\$- 4.5 in R, and a rate of 5.0 +\$\textbackslash backslash\$- 1.2 mmag/yr averaged over the two warm Spitzer bands. Although the dimming is small, it is seen at \textbackslash textgreater= 3 sigma by three different observatories operating from the UV to the IR. The presence of long-term secular dimming means that previous SED models of the star based on photometric measurements taken years apart may not be accurate. We find that stellar models with T\_\{eff\} = 7000 - 7100 K and A\_V {$\sim$} 0.73 best fit the Swift data from UV to optical. These models also show no excess in the near-simultaneous Spitzer photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, although a longer wavelength excess from a substantial debris disk is still possible (e.g., as around Fomalhaut). The wavelength dependence of the fading favors a relatively neutral color (i.e., R\_V \textbackslash textgreater= 5, but not flat across all the bands) compared with the extinction law for the general ISM (R\_V = 3.1), suggesting that the dimming arises from circumstellar material.},

  abstract = {The connection between the nature of a protoplanetary disk and that of a debris disk is not well understood. Dust evolution, planet formation, and disk dissipation likely play a role in the processes involved. We aim to reconcile both manifestations of dusty circumstellar disks through a study of optically thin Class III disks and how they correlate to younger and older disks. In this work, we collect literature and ALMA archival millimeter fluxes for 85 disks (8\%) of all Class III disks across nearby star-forming regions. We derive millimeter-dust masses and compare these with Class II and debris disk samples in the context of excess infrared luminosity, accretion rate, and age. The mean dust mass \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashtext\{dust\}\}\$ of Class III disks is \$0.29 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.19{$\sim$}M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. We propose a new evolutionary scenario wherein radial drift is very efficient for non-structured disks during the Class II phase resulting in a rapid decrease of \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashtext\{dust\}\}\$, whereas disk dissipation is a more gradual process. We find long infrared protoplanetary disk timescales of \$\{\textbackslash backslashsim\}\$9-10 Myr, which are also consistent with slow disk evolution. Finally, in structured disks, the presence of dust traps allows for the formation of planetesimal belts at large radii, such as those observed in debris disks. We propose that structured disks are thus directly connected to debris disks in one evolutionary pathway, in contrast to radial drift dominated disks which evolve to near diskless stars. These results set the scene for a novel view of disk evolution.},

We performed simulations adopting a massive, static, low-viscosity circumplanetary disk model, in agreement with a current study of magnetorotational instability in a circum-planetary disk. We find that the high gas density leads to very rapid migration of satellitesimals due to gas drag and type II migration of satellites in a faster disk-dominated mode. A large concentration of solids, large building blocks and longer type II migration time-scales favor formation and survival of large satellites. However, bodies as massive as Ganymede and those located far away from Jupiter, such as Callisto, are difficult to form with this scenario.},

We explore the formation of such planets with a population synthesis code based on a planetesimal-driven model previously used to study the formation of the Jovian satellites. Because the discs have low mass and the stars are cool, the formation is an inefficient process that happens at short periods, generating compact planetary systems. Planets can be trapped in resonances and we follow the evolution of the planets after the gas has dissipated and they undergo orbit crossings and possible mergers. We find that formation of planets above Mars mass and in the planetesimal accretion scenario, is only possible around stars with masses M{${_\ast}$} \textbackslash textgreater 0.07Msun and discs of Mdisc \textbackslash textgreater 10-2Msun. We find that planets above Earth-mass form around stars with masses larger than 0.15Msun, while planets larger than 5M{$\odot$} do not form in our model, even not under the most optimal conditions (massive disc), showing that planets such as GJ 3512b form with another, more efficient mechanism. Our results show that the majority of planets form with a significant water fraction; that most of our synthetic planetary systems have 1, 2, or 3 planets, but those with 4, 5, 6, and 7 planets are also common, confirming that compact planetary systems with many planets should be a relatively common outcome of planet formation around small stars.},

The number of planets with optical phase curve detections, however, is currently too small to study them as an aggregate population, motivating an extension of the search to non-transiting planets. Here we present an algorithm for the detection of non-transiting, short-period giant planets in the Kepler field. The procedure uses the phase curves themselves as evidence for the planets' existence. We employ a supervised learning algorithm to recognize the salient time-dependent properties of synthetic phase curves; we then search for detections of signals that match these properties. After demonstrating the algorithm's capabilities, we classify 142,630 FGK Kepler stars without confirmed planets or KOIs and, for each one, assign a probability of a phase curve of a non-transiting planet being present. We identify 60 high-probability non-transiting hot Jupiter candidates. We also derive constraints on the candidates' albedos and offsets of the phase curve maxima. These targets are strong candidates for follow-up radial velocity confirmation and characterization. Once confirmed, the atmospheric information content in the phase curves may be studied in yet greater detail.},

By studying a uniform sample of Kepler "multis" with mass measurements from transit timing variations (TTVs), we show that a given planetary system tends to harbor a characteristic type of planet. That is, planets in a system have both masses and radii that are far more similar than if the system were assembled randomly from planets in the population. This finding has two important ramifications. First, the large intrinsic compositional scatter in the planet mass-radius relation is dominated by system-to-system variance rather than intra-system variance. Second, if provided enough properties of the star and primordial protoplanetary disk, there may be a substantial degree of predictability in the outcome of the planet formation process. We show that stellar mass and metallicity account for of order \$20\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the variation in outcomes; the remainder is as-yet unknown.},

The nearby M4V dwarf hosts four known planets, the outer three of which are trapped in a Laplace mean-motion resonance. A thorough characterization of the complex resonant perturbations exhibited by the orbiting planets, and the chaotic dynamics therein, is key to a complete picture of the system's formation and evolutionary history. Here we present a reanalysis of the system using six years of new radial velocity (RV) data from four instruments. This new data augments and more than doubles the size of the decades-long collection of existing velocity measurements. We provide updated estimates of the system parameters by employing a computationally efficient Wisdom-Holman N-body symplectic integrator, coupled with a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model to account for correlated stellar noise. Experiments with synthetic RV data show that the dynamical characterization of the system can differ depending on whether a white noise or correlated noise model is adopted. Despite there being a region of stability for an additional planet in the resonant chain, we find no evidence for one. Our new parameter estimates place the system even deeper into resonance than previously thought and suggest that the system might be in a low energy, quasi-regular double apsidal corotation resonance. This result and others will be used in a subsequent study on the primordial migration processes responsible for the formation of the resonant chain.},

  author = {Millholland, Sarah and Spalding, Christopher},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Small, rocky planets have been found orbiting in extreme proximity to their host stars, sometimes down to only \$\textbackslash backslashsim 2\$ stellar radii. These ultra-short-period planets (USPs) likely did not form in their present-day orbits, but rather migrated from larger initial separations. While tides are the probable cause of this migration, the tidal source has remained uncertain. Here we introduce planetary obliquity tides as a natural pathway for the production of USPs within close-in multi-planet systems. The crucial idea is that tidal dissipation generally forces planetary spin vectors to equilibrium configurations called "Cassini states", in which the planetary obliquities (axial tilts) are non-zero. In these cases, sustained tidal dissipation and inward orbital migration are inevitable. Migration then increases the obliquity and strengthens the tides, creating a positive feedback loop. Thus, if a planet's initial semi-major axis is small enough (\$a \textbackslash backslashlesssim 0.05\$ AU), it can experience runaway orbital decay, which is stalled at ultra-short orbital periods when the forced obliquity reaches very high values (\$\textbackslash backslashsim 85\^\{\textbackslash backslashcirc\}\$) and becomes unstable. We use secular dynamics to outline the parameter space in which the innermost member of a prototypical Kepler multiple-planet system can become a USP. We find that these conditions are consistent with many observed features of USPs, such as period ratios, mutual inclinations, and occurrence rate trends with stellar type. Future detections of stellar obliquities and close-in companions, together with theoretical explorations of the potential for chaotic obliquity dynamics, can help constrain the prevalence of this mechanism.},

  abstract = {While the Solar System contains no planets between the sizes of Uranus and Saturn, our current exoplanet census includes several dozen such planets with well-measured masses and radii. These sub-Saturns exhibit a diversity of bulk densities, ranging from {$\sim\$$}0.1-3\textbackslash backslash \textbackslash backslashrm\{g\textbackslash backslash cm\}\^\{-3\}\$. When modeled simply as hydrogen/helium envelopes atop rocky cores, this diversity in densities translates to a diversity in planetary envelope fractions, \$f\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}=M\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}/M\_p\$ ranging from {$\sim\$$}10\textbackslash backslash\%\$ to {$\sim\$$}50\textbackslash backslash\%\$. Planets with \$f\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}\textbackslash backslashsim50\textbackslash backslash\%\$ pose a challenge to traditional models of giant planet formation by core-nucleated accretion, which predict the onset of runaway gas accretion when \$M\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}\textbackslash backslashsim M\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{core\}\$. Here we show that many of these apparent \$f\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}\textbackslash backslashsim50\textbackslash backslash\%\$ planets are less envelope rich than they seem, after accounting for tidal heating. We present a new framework for modeling sub-Saturn interiors that incorporates envelope inflation due to tides, which are driven by the observed non-zero eccentricities, as well as potential obliquities. Consequently, when we apply our models to known sub-Saturns, we infer lower \$f\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}\$ than tides-free estimates. We present a case study of K2-19 b, a moderately eccentric sub-Saturn. Neglecting tides, K2-19 b appears to have \$f\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}\textbackslash backslashsim50\textbackslash backslash\%\$, poised precariously near the runaway threshold; by including tides, we find \$f\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}\textbackslash backslashsim10\textbackslash backslash\%\$, resolving the tension. Through a systematic analysis of \$4-8\textbackslash backslash R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ planets, we find that most (but not all) of the similarly envelope-rich planets have more modest envelopes of \$f\_\textbackslash backslashrm\{env\}\textbackslash backslashsim10\textbackslash backslash\%-20\textbackslash backslash\%\$. Thus, many sub-Saturns may be understood as sub-Neptunes that have undergone significant radius inflation, rather than a separate class of objects. Tidal radius inflation likely plays an important role in other size classes of planets including ultra-low-density Jupiter-size planets like WASP-107 b.},

This work characterizes three such systems. We present Kepler-65, a system with an eccentric (e=0.28+/-0.07) giant planet companion discovered via radial velocities (RVs) exterior to a compact, multiply-transiting system of sub-Neptune planets. We also use precision RVs to improve mass and radius constraints on two other systems with similar architectures, Kepler-25 and Kepler-68. In Kepler-68 we propose a second exterior giant planet candidate. Finally, we consider the implications of these systems for planet formation models, particularly that the moderate eccentricity in Kepler-65's exterior giant planet did not disrupt its inner system.},

  abstract = {An era has started in which gas and dust can be observed independently in protoplanetary disks, thanks to the recent surveys with ALMA. The first near-complete high-resolution disk survey in both dust and gas in a single star-forming region has been carried out in Lupus, finding surprisingly low gas/dust ratios. The goal of this work is to fully exploit CO isotopologues observations in Lupus, comparing them with physical-chemical model results, in order to obtain gas masses for a large number of disks. We have employed physical-chemical models to analyze continuum and CO isotopologues observations of Lupus disks, including isotope-selective processes and freeze-out. Employing also the ALMA 13CO-only detections, disk gas masses have been calculated for a total of 34 sources, expanding the sample of 10 disks studied by Ansdell et al. (2016), where also C18O was detected. We confirm that overall gas-masses are very low, often smaller than 1 \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$, if volatile carbon is not depleted. Accordingly, global gas/dust ratios predominantly between 1 and 10. Low CO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios may indicate rapid loss of gas, or alternatively chemical evolution, e.g. via sequestering of carbon from CO to more complex molecules, or carbon locked up in larger bodies. Current ALMA observations cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses. We have simulated both scenarios, but chemical model results do not allow us to rule out one of the two. Assuming that all Lupus disks have evolved mainly due to viscous processes over the past few Myr, the observed correlation between the current mass accretion rate and dust mass found by Manara et al. (2016) implies a constant gas-to-dust ratio, which is close to 100 based on the observed \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm disk\}/\textbackslash backslashdot\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm acc\}\$ ratio. This in turn points to a scenario in which carbon depletion is responsible for the low CO isotopologue line luminosities.},

  abstract = {Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are commonly thought to have accreted hydrogen/helium envelopes, consisting of a few to ten percent of their total mass, from the primordial gas disk. Subsequently, hydrodynamic escape driven by core-powered mass-loss and/or photo-evaporation likely stripped much of these primordial envelopes from the lower-mass and closer-in planets to form the super-Earth population. In this work we show that after undergoing core-powered mass-loss, some super-Earths can retain small residual H/He envelopes. This retention is possible because, for significantly depleted atmospheres, the density at the radiative-convective boundary drops sufficiently such that thhe cooling time-scale becomes less than the mass-loss time-scale. The residual envelope is therefore able to contract, terminating further mass loss. Using analytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that the mass of primordial H/He envelope retained as a fraction of the planet's total mass, \$f\_\{ret\}\$, increases with increasing planet mass, \$M\_\{c\}\$, and decreases with increasing equilibrium temperature, \$T\_\{eq\}\$, scaling as \$f\_\{ret\} \textbackslash backslashpropto M\_\{c\}\^\{3/2\} T\_\{eq\}\^\{-1/2\} \textbackslash backslashexp\{[M\_\{c\}\^\{3/4\} T\_\{eq\}\^\{-1\}]\}\$. \$f\_\{ret\}\$ varies from \$\textbackslash textless 10\^\{-8\}\$ to about \$10\^\{-3\}\$ for typical super-Earth parameters. To first order, the exact amount of left-over H/He depends on the initial envelope mass, the planet mass, its equilibrium temperature, and the envelope's opacity. These residual hydrogen envelopes reduce the atmosphere's mean molecular weight compared to a purely secondary atmosphere, a signature observable by current and future facilities. These remnant atmospheres may, however, in many cases be vulnerable to long-term erosion by photo-evaporation. Any residual hydrogen envelope likely plays an important role in the long-term physical evolution of super-Earths, including their geology and geochemistry.},

When a protoplanet becomes greater than the moon's mass, an appreciable amount of the gas of the solar nebula is attracted by the protoplanet to form a gaseous envelope surrounding it.We have studied the structure and stability of this envelope, which depend on the mass of the protoplanet, on the assumption that the envelope is spherically-symmetric, in hydro-static equilibrium and, thermally, isothermal in the outer optically-thin region but adiabatic in the inner region. The existence of the isothermal region is due to a circumstance that the opacity of the gas is very low since almost all of grains have already condensed into planetesimals and protoplanets.We have found that, when the mass of a protoplanet becomes greater than a certain critical value which depends on the opacity, the envelope can no longer be in hydrostatic equilibrium and begins to collapse. For a roughly estimated value of the opacity, the critical mass is of the order of 15ME and 6ME (ME being the Earth's mass) for proto-Jupiter and proto-Saturn, respectively. These masses are about one fifth and one tenth of the values found by Perri and Cameron, but they are consistent with recent Slattery's models of the present Jupiter and Saturn.},

Under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, the structure has been calculated for the regions of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Energy transfer in the envelope has been taken into account precisely.When the core mass increases beyond some critical value, the envelope cannot be in hydrostatic equilibrium and collapses onto the core. The most remarkable result is that a common relation between the core mass and the total mass holds irrespectively of the regions in the solar nebula. Therefore, at the collapse, the core mass becomes almost the same regardless of the regions in the nebula. This is consistent with the conclusion obtained from the theory of internal structure of the present giant planets. The grain opacity in the envelope should be about 1cm2/g in order to explain the estimated core mass (about 10 Earth's mass) of the giant planets. The value of the grain opacity is larger than that expected before.},

(2017) with one peak at \$\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashsim 1.3 R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\} \$ the other at \$\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashsim 2.4 R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\} \$ and the minimum at \$\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashsim 1.75R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\} \$. In this paper we focus on the hypothesis that the exoplanet size distribution is caused by stellar XUV-induced atmospheric loss. We evolve \$10\^\{6\}\$ synthetic exoplanets by exposing them to XUV irradiation from synthetic ZAMS stars. For each planet we set a different interior composition which ranged from \$\textbackslash backslashrm 100 \textbackslash backslash: wt\textbackslash backslash\%\$ Fe (very dense) through \$\textbackslash backslashrm 100 \textbackslash backslash: wt\textbackslash backslash\%\$ \$\textbackslash backslashrm MgSiO\_\{3\}\$ (average density) and to \$\textbackslash backslashrm 100 \textbackslash backslash: wt\textbackslash backslash\%\$ \$\textbackslash backslashrm H\_\{2\}O\$ ice (low density) with varying hydrogen envelop sizes which varied from \$\textbackslash backslashrm 0 \textbackslash backslash: wt\textbackslash backslash\%\$ (a negligible envelop) to \$\textbackslash backslashrm 100 \textbackslash backslash: wt\textbackslash backslash\%\$ (a negligible core). Our simulations were able to replicate the bimodal distribution in exoplanet radii. We argue that in order to reproduce the distribution by Fulton et al. (2017) it is mandatory for there to be a paucity of exoplanets with masses above \$\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashsim 8M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. Furthermore, our best-fit result predicts an initial flat distribution in exoplanet occurrence for \$\textbackslash backslashrm M\_\{P\} \textbackslash backslashlesssim 8M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ with a strong deficiency for planets with \$\textbackslash backslashrm \textbackslash backslashlesssim 3M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$.

  abstract = {Almost all planetary atmospheres are affected by disequilibrium chemical processes. In this paper we introduce our recently developed Chemical Kinetic Model (\$\textbackslash backslash\$texttt\{ChemKM\}). We show that the results of our HD189733b model are in good agreement with previously published results, except at \$\textbackslash backslashmu\$bar regime, where molecular diffusion and photochemistry are the dominant processes. We thus recommend careful consideration of these processes when abundances at the top of the atmosphere are desired. We also propose a new metric for a quantitative measure of quenching levels. By applying this metric, we find that quenching pressure decreases with the effective temperature of planets, but it also varies significantly with other atmospheric parameters such as [Fe/H], log(g), and C/O. In addition, we find that the "Methane Valley", a region between 800 and 1500K where above a certain C/O threshold value a greater chance of CH\$\_4\$ detection is expected, still exists after including the vertical mixing. The first robust CH\$\_4\$ detection on an irradiated planet (HD102195b) places this object within this region; supporting our prediction. We also investigate the detectability of disequilibrium spectral fingerprints by JWST, and suggest focusing on the targets with T\$\_\{eff\}\$ between 1000 and 1800K, orbiting around M-dwarfs, having low surface gravity but high metallicity and a C/O ratio value around unity. Finally, constructing Spitzer color-maps suggests that the main two color-populations are largely insensitive to the vertical mixing. Therefore any deviation of observational points from these populations are likely due to the presence of clouds and not disequilibrium processes. However, some cold planets (T\$\_\{eff\}\textbackslash textless\$900K) with very low C/O ratios (\$\textbackslash textless\$0.25) show significant deviations; making these planets interesting cases for further investigation.},

  abstract = {A carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) of around unity is believed to act as a natural separator of water- and methane-dominated spectra when characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. In this paper we quantify the C/O ratios at which this separation occurs by calculating a large self-consistent grid of cloud-free atmospheric models in chemical equilibrium, using the latest version of petitCODE. Our study covers a broad range of parameter space: 400 K\$\textbackslash textless\$T\$\_\{eff\}\textbackslash textless\$2600 K, 2.0\$\textbackslash textless\$log(g)\$\textbackslash textless\$5.0, -1.0\$\textbackslash textless\$[Fe/H]\$\textbackslash textless\$2.0, 0.25\$\textbackslash textless\$C/O\$\textbackslash textless\$1.25, and stellar types from M to F. We make the synthetic transmission and emission spectra, as well as the temperature structures publicly available. We find that the transition C/O ratio depends on many parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and spectral type of the host star, and could have values less, equal, or higher than unity. By mapping all the transition C/O ratios we propose a "four-class" classification scheme for irradiated planets in this temperature range. We find a parameter space where methane always remains the cause of dominant spectral features. CH\$\_4\$ detection in this region, or the lack of it, provides a diagnostic tool to identify the prevalence of cloud formation and non-equilibrium chemistry. As another diagnostic tool, we construct synthetic Spitzer IRAC color-diagrams showing two distinguishable populations of planets. Since most of the exoplanet atmospheres appear cloudy when studied in transmission, we regard this study as a starting point of how such a C/O-sensitive observation-based classification scheme should be constructed. This preparatory work will have to be refined by future cloudy and non-equilibrium modeling, to further investigate the existence and exact location of the classes, as well as the color-diagram analysis.},

  abstract = {Observations suggest an abundance of water and paucity of methane in the majority of observed exoplanetary atmospheres. We isolate the effect of atmospheric processes to investigate possible causes. Previously, we studied the effect of effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and stellar type assuming cloud-free thermochemical equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. However, under these assumptions, methane remains a persisting spectral feature in the transmission spectra of exoplanets over a certain parameter space, the Methane Valley. In this work we investigate the role of clouds on this domain and we find that clouds change the spectral appearance of methane in two direct ways: 1) by heating-up the photosphere of colder planets, and 2) by obscuring molecular features. The presence of clouds also affects methane features indirectly: 1) cloud heating results in more evaporation of condensates and hence releases additional oxygen, causing water dominated spectra of colder carbon-poor exoplanets, and 2) HCN/CO production results in a suppression of depleted methane features by these molecules. The presence of HCN/CO and a lack of methane could be an indication of cloud formation on hot exoplanets. Cloud heating can also deplete ammonia. Therefore, a simultaneous depletion of methane and ammonia is not unique to photochemical processes. We propose that the best targets for methane detection are likely to be massive but smaller planets with a temperature around 1450 K orbiting colder stars. We also construct Spitzer synthetic color-maps and find that clouds can explain some of the high contrast observations by IRAC's channel 1 and 2.},

This indicates that these planets formed early in gas-rich disks while avoiding the runaway gas accretion that would otherwise have turned them into hot-Jupiters. A solution is to invoke a long Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction (or cooling) timescale, but it has also been suggested that thermodynamical cooling can be prevented by hydrodynamical planet atmosphere-disk recycling. Aims. We investigate the efficacy of the recycling hypothesis in preventing the collapse of the atmosphere, check for the existence of a steady state configuration, and determine the final atmospheric mass to core mass ratio. Methods. We use three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to model the formation of planetary proto-Atmospheres. Equations are solved in a local frame centered on the planet. Results. Ignoring small oscillations that average to zero over time, the simulations converge to a steady state where the velocity field of the gas becomes constant in time. In a steady state, the energy loss by radiative cooling is fully compensated by the recycling of the low entropy gas in the planetary atmosphere with high entropy gas from the circumstellar disk. Conclusions. For close-in planets, recycling naturally halts the cooling of planetary proto-Atmospheres, preventing them from contracting toward the runaway regime and collapsing into gas giants.},

We provide self-consistent atmospheric models and synthetic JWST observations for prime exoplanet targets in order to identify spectral regions of interest and estimate the number of transits needed to distinguish between model setups. Methods. We select targets that span a wide range of planetary temperatures and surface gravities, ranging from super-Earths to giant planets, that have a high expected signal-to-noise ratio. For all targets, we vary the enrichment, C/O ratio, presence of optical absorbers (TiO/VO), and cloud treatment. We calculate atmospheric structures, emission, and transmission spectra for all targets and use a radiometric model to obtain simulated observations. Further, we analyze JWST's ability to distinguish between various scenarios. Results. We find that in very cloudy planets, such as GJ 1214b, less than ten transits with NIRSpec may be enough to reveal molecular features. Furthermore, the presence of small silicate grains in atmospheres of hot Jupiters may be detectable with a single JWST MIRI transit. For a more detailed characterization of such particles less than ten transits are necessary. Finally, we find that some of the hottest hot Jupiters are well fitted by models which neglect the redistribution of the insolation and harbor inversions, and that 1-4 eclipse measurements with NIRSpec are needed to distinguish between the inversion models. Conclusions. Wet thus demonstrate the capabilities of JWST for solving some of the most intriguing puzzles in current exoplanet atmospheric research. Further, by publishing all models calculated for this study we enable the community to carry out similar studies, as well as retrieval analyses for all planets included in our target list.},

Clouds can be included and treated using wavelength-dependent power law opacities, or by using optical constants of real condensates, specifying either the cloud particle size, or the atmospheric mixing and particle settling strength. Opacities of amorphous or crystalline, spherical or irregularly-shaped cloud particles are available. The line opacity database spans temperatures between 80 and 3000 K, allowing to model fluxes of objects such as terrestrial planets, super-Earths, Neptunes, or hot Jupiters, if their atmospheres are hydrogen-dominated. Higher temperature points and species will be added in the future, allowing to also model the class of ultra hot-Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures \$T\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm eq\} \textbackslash backslashgtrsim 2000\$ K. Radiative transfer results were tested by cross-verifying the low- and high-resolution implementation of petitRADTRANS, and benchmarked with the petitCODE, which itself is also benchmarked to the ATMO and Exo-REM codes.

Two cloud model parameterizations are tested: the first incorporates the mixing and settling of condensates, the second simply parameterizes the functional form of the opacity. In mock retrievals, using an inadequate cloud model may result in atmospheres that are more isothermal and less cloudy than the input. Applying our framework on observations of HR 8799e made with the GPI, SPHERE and GRAVITY, we find a cloudy atmosphere governed by disequilibrium chemistry, confirming previous analyses. We retrieve that \$\{\textbackslash backslashrm C/O\}=0.60\_\{-0.08\}\^\{+0.07\}\$. Other models have not yet produced a well constrained C/O value for this planet. The retrieved C/O values of both cloud models are consistent, while leading to different atmospheric structures: cloudy, or more isothermal and less cloudy. Fitting the observations with the self-consistent Exo-REM model leads to comparable results, while not constraining C/O. With data from the most sensitive instruments, retrieval analyses of directly imaged planets are possible. The inferred C/O ratio of HR 8799e is independent of the cloud model and thus appears to be a robust. This C/O is consistent with stellar, which could indicate that the HR 8799e formed outside the CO\$\_2\$ or CO iceline. As it is the innermost planet of the system, this constraint could apply to all HR 8799 planets.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disk mass is a key parameter controlling the process of planetary system formation. CO molecular emission is often used as a tracer of gas mass in the disk. In this study we consider the ability of CO to trace the gas mass over a wide range of disk structural parameters and search for chemical species that could possibly be used as alternative mass tracers to CO. Specifically, we apply detailed astrochemical modeling to a large set of models of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, to select molecules with abundances correlated with the disk mass and being relatively insensitive to other disk properties. We do not consider sophisticated dust evolution models, restricting ourselves with the standard astrochemical assumption of 0.1 \textmu m dust. We find that CO is indeed the best molecular tracer for total gas mass, despite the fact that it is not the main carbon carrier, provided reasonable assumptions about CO abundance in the disk are used. Typically, chemical reprocessing lowers the abundance of CO by a factor of 3, compared to the case of photo-dissociation and freeze-out as the only ways of CO depletion. On average only 13\% C-atoms reside in gas-phase CO, albeit with variations from 2 to 30\%. CO2, H2O and H2CO can potentially serve as alternative mass tracers, the latter two being only applicable if disk structural parameters are known.},

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Transition discs are expected to be a natural outcome of the interplay between photoevaporation (PE) and giant planet formation. Massive planets reduce the inflow of material from the outer to the inner disc, therefore triggering an earlier onset of disc dispersal due to PE through a process known as Planet-Induced PhotoEvaporation (PIPE). In this case, a cavity is formed as material inside the planetary orbit is removed by PE, leaving only the outer disc to drive the migration of the giant planet. We investigate the impact of PE on giant planet migration and focus specifically on the case of transition discs with an evacuated cavity inside the planet location. This is important for determining under what circumstances PE is efficient at halting the migration of giant planets, thus affecting the final orbital distribution of a population of planets. For this purpose, we use 2D FARGO simulations to model the migration of giant planets in a range of primordial and transition discs subject to PE. The results are then compared to the standard prescriptions used to calculate the migration tracks of planets in 1D planet population synthesis models. The FARGO simulations show that once the disc inside the planet location is depleted of gas, planet migration ceases. This contradicts the results obtained by the impulse approximation, which predicts the accelerated inward migration of planets in discs that have been cleared inside the planetary orbit. These results suggest that the impulse approximation may not be suitable for planets embedded in transition discs. A better approximation that could be used in 1D models would involve halting planet migration once the material inside the planetary orbit is depleted of gas and the surface density at the 3:2 mean motion resonance location in the outer disc reaches a threshold value of \$0.01\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{g\textbackslash backslash,cm\^\{-2\}\}\$.},

  abstract = {Doppler-based planet surveys have discovered numerous giant planets but are incomplete beyond several AU. At larger star-planet separations, direct planet detection through high-contrast imaging has proven successful, but this technique is sensitive only to young planets and characterization relies upon theoretical evolution models. Here we demonstrate that radial velocity measurements and high-contrast imaging can be combined to overcome these issues. The presence of widely separated companions can be deduced by identifying an acceleration (long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star. By obtaining high spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we rule out scenarios in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binary companions with high statistical confidence. We report results from an analysis of Doppler measurements of a sample of 111 M-dwarf stars with a median of 29 radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr. By targeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration ("trend") with adaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5\% {$\pm$} 3.0\% of M-dwarf stars host one or more massive companions with 1 \textbackslash textless m/MJ \textbackslash textless 13 and 0 \textbackslash textless a \textbackslash textless 20 AU. These results are lower than analyses of the planet occurrence rate around higher-mass stars. We find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by a double power law in stellar mass M and metallicity F {$\equiv$} [Fe/H] such that. Our results are consistent with gravitational microlensing measurements of the planet occurrence rate; this study represents the first model-independent comparison with microlensing observations. \textcopyright{} 2014.

  abstract = {If confirmed, the Neptune-size exomoon candidate in the Kepler 1625 system will be the first natural satellite outside our Solar System. Its characteristics are nothing alike we know for a satellite. Kepler 1625b I is expected to be as massive as Neptune and to orbit at 40 planetary radii around a ten Jupiter mass planet. Because of its mass and wide orbit, this satellite was firstly thought to be captured instead of formed in-situ. In this work, we investigated the possibility of an in-situ formation of this exomoon candidate. To do so, we performed N-body simulations to reproduce the late phases of satellite formation and use a massive circum-planetary disc to explain the mass of this satellite. Our setups started soon after the gaseous nebula dissipation, when the satellite embryos are already formed. Also for selected exomoon systems we take into account a post-formation tidal evolution. We found that in-situ formation is viable to explain the origin of Kepler 1625b I, even when different values for the star-planet separation are considered. We show that for different star-planet separations the minimum amount of solids needed in the circum-planetary disc to form such a satellite varies, the wider is this separation more material is needed. In our simulations of satellite formation many satellites were formed close to the planet, this scenario changed after the tidal evolution of the systems. We concluded that if the Kepler1625 b satellite system was formed in-situ, tidal evolution was an important mechanism to sculpt its final architecture.},

Our investigation extends the previous works by Masset and Snellgrove (2001) and Morbidelli and Crida (2007, MC07), which focussed on the dynamics of the Jupiter-Saturn system. The only systems that we found to reach a steady state are those in which the planets are locked in a quadruple mean motion resonance (i.e. each planet is in resonance with its neighbor). In total we found 6 such configurations. For the gas disk parameters found in MC07, these configurations are characterized by a negligible migration rate. After the disappearance of the gas, and in absence of planetesimals, only two of these six configurations (the least compact ones) are stable for a time of hundreds of millions of years or more. The others become unstable on a timescale of a few My. Our preliminary simulations show that, when a planetesimal disk is added beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, the planets can evolve from the most stable of these configurations to their current orbits in a fashion qualitatively similar to that described in Tsiganis et al. (2005).},

We attempt to answer this question by conducting coagulation simulations in which the planetesimals grow by mutual collisions and form larger bodies and planetary embryos. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of the initial planetesimals is considered a free parameter in these simulations, and we search for the one that produces at the end objects with a SFD that is consistent with Asteroid belt constraints. We find that, if the initial planetesimals were small (e.g. km-sized), the final SFD fails to fulfill these constraints. In particular, reproducing the bump observed at diameter D {$\sim$} 100 km in the current SFD of the asteroids requires that the minimal size of the initial planetesimals was also {$\sim$}100 km. This supports the idea that planetesimals formed big, namely that the size of solids in the proto-planetary disk "jumped" from sub-meter scale to multi-kilometer scale, without passing through intermediate values. Moreover, we find evidence that the initial planetesimals had to have sizes ranging from 100 to several 100 km, probably even 1000 km, and that their SFD had to have a slope over this interval that was similar to the one characterizing the current asteroids in the same size range. This result sets a new constraint on planetesimal formation models and opens new perspectives for the investigation of the collisional evolution in the Asteroid and Kuiper belts as well as of the accretion of the cores of the giant planets. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, Lambrechts \& Johansen (2012, A\&A, 544, A32, LJ12) proposed a new model in which the cores grow by the accretion of pebble-size objects, as the latter drift towards the star due to gas drag. Aims. We investigate the dynamics of pebble-size objects in the vicinity of planetary embryos of 1 and 5 Earth masses and the resulting accretion rates. Methods. We use hydrodynamical simulations, in which the embryo influences the dynamics of the gas and the pebbles suffer gas drag according to the local gas density and velocities. Results. The pebble dynamics in the vicinity of the planetary embryo is non-trivial, and it changes significantly with the pebble size. Nevertheless, the accretion rate of the embryo that we measure is within an order of magnitude of the rate estimated in LJ12 and tends to their value with increasing pebble-size. Conclusions. The model by LJ12 has the potential to explain the rapid growth of giant planet cores. The actual accretion rates however, depend on the surface density of pebble size objects in the disk, which is unknown to date. \textcopyright 2012 ESO.},

This is the result of the formation of a system of multiple embryos with approximately the mass of Mars in the inner disk and of a few multi-Earth-mass cores in the outer disk, within the lifetime of the gaseous component of the protoplanetary disk. What was the origin of this dichotomy in the mass distribution of embryos/cores? We show in this paper that the classic processes of runaway and oligarchic growth from a disk of planetesimals cannot explain this dichotomy, even if the original surface density of solids increased at the snowline. Instead, the accretion of drifting pebbles by embryos and cores can explain the dichotomy, provided that some assumptions hold true. We propose that the mass-flow of pebbles is two-times lower and the characteristic size of the pebbles is approximately ten times smaller within the snowline than beyond the snowline (respectively at heliocentric distance r \textbackslash textless r ice and r \textbackslash textgreater rice , where rice is the snowline heliocentric distance), due to ice sublimation and the splitting of icy pebbles into a collection of chondrule-size silicate grains. In this case, objects of original sub-lunar mass would grow at drastically different rates in the two regions of the disk. Within the snowline these bodies would reach approximately the mass of Mars while beyond the snowline they would grow to {$\sim$} 20 Earth masses. The results may change quantitatively with changes to the assumed parameters, but the establishment of a clear dichotomy in the mass distribution of protoplanets appears robust provided that there is enough turbulence in the disk to prevent the sedimentation of the silicate grains into a very thin layer.},

Senckenberganlage 25,ABSTRACT The Al/Si and Mg/Si ratios in non-carbonaceous chondrites are lower than the solar (i.e., CI-chondritic) values, in sharp contrast to the non-CI carbonaceous meteorites and the Earth, which are enriched in refractory elements and have Mg/Si ratios that are solar or larger. We show that the formation of a first generation of planetesimals during the condensation of refractory elements implies the subsequent formation of residual condensates with strongly sub-solar Al/Si and Mg/Si ratios. The mixing of residual condensates with different amounts of material with solar refractory/Si element ratios explains the Al/Si and Mg/Si values of non-carbonaceous chondrites. To match quantitatively the observed ratios, we find that the first-planetesimals should have accreted when the disk temperature was {$\sim$} 1, 330-1, 400 K depending on pressure and assuming a solar C/O ratio of the disk. We discuss how this model relates to our current understanding of disk evolution, grain dynamics, and planetesimal formation. We also extend the discussion to moderately volatile elements (e.g., Na), explaining how it may be possible that the depletion of these elements in non-carbonaceous chondrites is correlated with the depletion of refractory elements (e.g., Al). Extending the analysis to Cr, we find evidence for a higher than solar C/O ratio in the protosolar disk's gas when/where condensation from a fractionated gas occurred. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the supra-solar Al/Si and Mg/Si ratios of the Earth are due to the accretion of {$\sim$} 40\% of the mass of our planet from the first-generation of refractory-rich planetesimals.},

  abstract = {In this work we combine several constraints provided by the crater records on Arrokoth and the worlds of the Pluto system to compute the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the crater production function for craters with diameter D {$\lessequivlnt$} 10 km. For this purpose, we use a Kuiper belt objects (KBO) population model calibrated on telescopic surveys, that describes also the evolution of the KBO population during the early Solar System. We further calibrate this model using the crater record on Pluto, Charon and Nix. Using this model, we compute the impact probability on Arrokoth, integrated over the age of the Solar System. This probability is then used together with other observational constraints to determine the slope of the crater-production function on Arrokoth. These constraints are: (i) the spatial density of sub-km craters, (ii) the absence of craters with 1 \textbackslash textless D \textbackslash textless 7 km; (iii) the existence of a single crater with D \textbackslash textgreater 7 km. In addition, we use our Kuiper belt model also to compare the impact rates and velocities of KBOs on Arrokoth with those on Charon, integrated over the crater retention ages of their respective surfaces. This allows us to establish a relationship between the spatial density of sub-km craters on Arrokoth and of D {$\sim$} 20 km craters on Charon. Together, all these considerations suggest the crater production function on these worlds has a cumulative power law slope of -1.5 \textbackslash textless q \textbackslash textless - 1.2. Converted into a projectile SFD slope, we find -1.2 \textbackslash textless qKBO \textbackslash textless - 1.0. These values are close to the cumulative slope of main belt asteroids in the 0.2\textendash 2 km range, a population in collisional equilibrium (Bottke et al., 2020). For KBOs, however, this slope appears to extend from {$\sim$}2 km down to objects a few tens of meters in diameter, as inferred from sub-km craters on Arrokoth. From the measurement of the dust density in the Kuiper belt made by the New Horizons mission, we predict that the SFD of the KBOs becomes steep again below {$\sim$}10\textendash 30 m. All these considerations strongly indicate that the size distribution of the KBO population is in collisional equilibrium.},

  abstract = {With the high number of extrasolar planets discovered by now, it becomes possible to constrain theoretical formation models in a statistical sense. This paper is the first in a series in which we carry out a large number of planet population synthesis calculations. We begin the series with a paper mainly dedicated to the presentation of our approach, but also the discussion of a representative synthetic planetary population of solar like stars. Based as tightly as possible on observational data, we have derived probability distributions for the most important initial conditions for the planetary formation process. We then draw sets of initial conditions from these distributions and obtain the corresponding synthetic planets with our formation model. Although the main purpose of this paper is the description of our methods, we present some key results: We find that the variation of the initial conditions in the limits occurring in nature leads to the formation of planets of large diversity. This formation process is best visualized in planetary formation tracks, where different phases of concurrent growth and migration can be identified. These phases lead to the emergence of sub-populations of planets distinguishable in a mass-semimajor axis diagram. The most important ones are the "failed cores", a vast group of core-dominated low mass planets, the "horizontal branch", a sub-population of Neptune mass planets extending out to 6 AU, and the "main clump", a concentration of giant gaseous giants planets at around 0.3-2 AU.},

In the companion paper (Paper I), we have presented in detail our methods. By applying an observational detection bias for radial velocity surveys, we identify the potentially detectable synthetic planets. The properties of these planets are compared in quantitative statistical tests with the properties of a carefully selected sub-population of actual exoplanets. We use a two dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the mass-distance distributions of synthetic and observed planets, as well as 1D KS tests to compare the mass, the semimajor axis and the [Fe/H] distributions. We find that some models can account to a reasonable degree of significance for the observed properties. We concurrently account for many other observed features, e.g. the "metallicity effect". This gives us confidence that our model captures several essential features of giant planet formation. Our simulations allow us also to extract the properties of the underlying exoplanet population that are not yet detectable. For example, we have derived the planetary initial mass function (PIMF) and have been led to conclude that the planets detected so far represent only the tip of the iceberg. The PIMF can also be used to predict how the detectable extrasolar planet population will change as the precision of radial velocity surveys improves to an extreme precision of 0.1 m/s.},

  abstract = {Context. A first characterization of extrasolar planets by the observational determination of the radius has recently been achieved for a large number of planets. For some planets, a measurement of the luminosity has also been possible, with many more directly imaged planets expected in the near future. The statistical characterization of exoplanets through their mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is becoming possible. This is for planet formation and evolution theory of similar importance as the mass-distance diagram. Aims. Our aim is to extend our planet-formation model into a coupled formation and evolution model. We want to calculate from one single model in a self-consistent way all basic quantities describing a planet: its mass, semimajor axis, composition, radius, and luminosity. We then want to use this model for population synthesis calculations. Methods. In this and a companion paper, we show how we solve the structure equations describing the gaseous envelope of a protoplanet during the early-formation phase, the gas runaway accretion phase, and the evolutionary phase at constant mass on Gyr timescales. We improve the model further with a new prescription for the disk-limited gas accretion rate, an internal structure model for the planetary core assuming a differentiated interior, and the inclusion of radioactive decay as an additional heat source in the core. Results. We study the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter, the mass-radius relationship of giant planets, the influence of the core mass on the radius, and the luminosity both in the "hot start" and the "cold start" scenario. Special emphasis is placed on the validation of the model by comparing it with other models of planet formation and evolution. We find that our results agree very well with those of more complex models, despite a number of simplifications we make in our calculations. Conclusions. The upgraded model yields the most important physical quantities describing a planet from its beginning as a tiny seed embryo to a Gyr-old planet. This is the case for all planets in a synthetic planetary population. Therefore, we can now use self-consistently the observational constraints coming from all major observational techniques. This is important in a time where different techniques yield constraints on very diverse sub-populations of planets, and where it is difficult to put all these constraints together in one coherent picture. Our comprehensive formation and evolution model should be helpful in this situation for the understanding of exoplanets. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2012.},

  abstract = {Context. This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet population synthesis calculations. In Paper I, we presented our methods. In Paper II, we compared the synthetic and the observed planetary population statistically. Paper III addressed the influences of the stellar mass on the population. Aims. Our goal in this fourth paper is to systematically study the effects of important disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass, and lifetime on fundamental properties of planets like mass and semimajor axis. Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks that have properties following distributions derived from observations, we calculated a population of planets with our formation model. The model is based on the classical core accretion paradigm but self-consistently includes planet migration and disk evolution. Results. We find a very large number of correlations. Regarding the planetary initial mass function, metallicity, M disk, and {$\tau$} disk play different roles. For high metallicities, giant planets are more frequent. For high M disk, giant planets are more massive. For long {$\tau$} disk, giant planets are both more frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets cannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are nearly uncorrelated. In contrast, (maximum) planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The formation of giant planets is possible for initial planetesimal surface densities {$\Sigma$} S of at least 6 g/cm 2 at 5.2 AU. The best spot for giant planet formation is at {$\sim$}5 AU. In-and outside this distance, higher {$\Sigma$} S are necessary. Low metallicities can be compensated for by high M disk, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low metallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk at high metallicities. The extent of migration increases with M disk and {$\tau$} disk and usually decreases with metallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis distribution of giant planets exists because in low-metallicity disks, planets start farther out, but migrate more, while the contrary applies to high metallicities. The final semimajor axis distribution contains an imprint of the ice line. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than hot Jupiters. The frequency of giant planets varies approximately as m disk1.2 and {$\tau$} disk2. Conclusions. The properties of protoplanetary disks-the initial and boundary conditions for planet formation-are decisive for the properties of planets, and leave many imprints on the population. \textcopyright{} 2012 ESO.},

  abstract = {Context. The research of extrasolar planets has entered an era in which we characterize extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of the radii of transiting planets and of the luminosity of planets observed by direct imaging. Meanwhile, the precision of radial velocity surveys makes it possible to discover not only giant planets but also very low-mass ones. Aims. Uniting all these different observational constraints into one coherent picture to better understand planet formation is an important and simultaneously difficult undertaking. One approach is to develop a theoretical model that can make testable predictions for all these observational techniques. Our goal is to have such a model and use it in population synthesis calculations. Methods. In a companion paper, we described how we have extended our formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model. In this second paper, we first continue with the model description. We describe how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core of the planet and include radiogenic heating. We also introduce an upgrade of the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we use the upgraded model in population synthesis calculations. Results. We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H 2/He envelopes forms and evolves in time. The basic shape of the mass-radius relationship can be understood from the core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to "forbidden" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable diversity of radii, mainly due to different bulk compositions, reflecting different formation histories. We compare the synthetic M-R plane with the observed one, finding good agreement for a \textbackslash textgreater 0.1 AU. The synthetic planetary radius distribution is characterized by a strong increase towards small R and a second, lower local maximum at about 1 R X. The increase towards small radii comes from the increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows good agreement for R {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 R {$\oplus$}, but divergence for smaller radii. This indicates that for R {$\greaterequivlnt$}2 R {$\oplus$} the radius distribution can be described with planets with primordial H 2/He atmospheres, while at smaller radii, planets of a different nature dominate. We predict that in the next few years, Kepler will find the second local maximum at about 1 R X. Conclusions. With the updated model, we can compute the most important quantities, like mass, semimajor axis, radius, and luminosity, which characterize an extrasolar planet self-consistently from its formation. The comparison of the radii of the synthetic planets with observations makes it possible to better constrain this formation process and to distinguish between fundamental types of planets. \textcopyright{} 2012 ESO.},

  abstract = {Despite the strong increase in observational data on extrasolar planets, the processes that led to the formation of these planets are still not well understood. However, thanks to the high number of extrasolar planets that have been discovered, it is now possible to look at the planets as a population that puts statistical constraints on theoretical formation models. A method that uses these constraints is planetary population synthesis where synthetic planetary populations are generated and compared to the actual population. The key element of the population synthesis method is a global model of planet formation and evolution. These models directly predict observable planetary properties based on properties of the natal protoplanetary disc, linking two important classes of astrophysical objects. To do so, global models build on the simplified results of many specialized models that address one specific physical mechanism. We thoroughly review the physics of the sub-models included in global formation models. The sub-models can be classified as models describing the protoplanetary disc (of gas and solids), those that describe one (proto)planet (its solid core, gaseous envelope and atmosphere), and finally those that describe the interactions (orbital migration and N-body interaction). We compare the approaches taken in different global models, discuss the links between specialized and global models, and identify physical processes that require improved descriptions in future work. We then shortly address important results of planetary population synthesis like the planetary mass function or the mass-radius relationship. With these statistical results, the global effects of physical mechanisms occurring during planet formation and evolution become apparent, and specialized models describing them can be put to the observational test. Owing to their nature as meta models, global models depend on the results of specialized models, and therefore on the development of the field of planet formation theory as a whole. Because there are important uncertainties in this theory, it is likely that the global models will in future undergo significant modifications. Despite these limitations, global models can already now yield many testable predictions. With future global models addressing the geophysical characteristics of the synthetic planets, it should eventually become possible to make predictions about the habitability of planets based on their formation and evolution.},

The chain links include (1) the planet's formation and migration, (2) its long-term thermodynamic evolution, (3) a variety of disk chemistry models, (4) a non-gray atmospheric model, and (5) a radiometric model to obtain simulated spectroscopic observations with JWST and ARIEL. In our standard chemistry model the inner disk is depleted in refractory carbon as in the Solar System and in white dwarfs polluted by extrasolar planetesimals. Our main findings are: (1) Envelope enrichment by planetesimal impacts during formation dominates the final planetary atmospheric composition of hot Jupiters. We investigate two, under this finding, prototypical formation pathways: a formation inside or outside the water iceline, called "dry" and "wet" planets, respectively. (2) Both the "dry" and "wet" planets are oxygen-rich (C/O\textbackslash textless1) due to the oxygen-rich nature of the solid building blocks. The "dry" planet's C/O ratio is \textbackslash textless0.2 for standard carbon depletion, while the "wet" planet has typical C/O values between 0.1 and 0.5 depending mainly on the clathrate formation efficiency. Only non-standard disk chemistries without carbon depletion lead to carbon-rich C/O ratios \textbackslash textgreater1 for the "dry" planet. (3) While we consistently find C/O ratios \textbackslash textless1, they still vary significantly. To link a formation history to a specific C/O, a better understanding of the disk chemistry is thus needed.},

In Paper I we described our global planet formation and evolution model that is based on the core accretion paradigm. In Paper II we studied the planetary mass-radius relationship with population syntheses. Aims. In this paper we present an extensive study of the statistics of planetary luminosities during both formation and evolution. Our results can be compared with individual directly imaged extrasolar (proto)planets and with statistical results from surveys. Methods. We calculated three populations of synthetic planets assuming different efficiencies of the accretional heating by gas and planetesimals during formation. We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary mass-luminosity relation. We investigate the relative importance of the shock and internal luminosity during formation, and predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass vs. entropy "tuning fork" diagram. Because the calculations now include deuterium burning we also update the planetary mass-radius relationship in time. Results. We find significant overlap between the high post-formation luminosities of planets forming with hot and cold gas accretion because of the core-mass effect. Variations in the individual formation histories of planets can still lead to a factor 5 to 20 spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass. However, if the gas accretional heating and planetesimal accretion rate during the runaway phase is unknown, the post-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of magnitude at a fixed mass. As a key result we predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep increase towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of low-mass (M \textbackslash textless 10-40 M{$\odot$}) planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. Conclusions. Our results indicate that during formation an estimation of the planetary mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the planetary gas accretion rate can be estimated. If it is unknown whether the planet still accretes gas, the spread in total luminosity (internal + accretional) at a given mass may be as large as two orders of magnitude, therefore inhibiting the mass estimation. Due to the core-mass effect even planets which underwent cold accretion can have large post-formation entropies and luminosities, such that alternative formation scenarios such as gravitational instabilities do not need to be invoked. Once the number of self-luminous exoplanets with known ages and luminosities increases, the resulting luminosity distributions may be compared with our predictions.},

  abstract = {In stellar astrophysics, the technique of population synthesis has been successfully used for several decades. For planets, it is in contrast still a young method which only became important in recent years because of the rapid increase of the number of known extrasolar planets, and the associated growth of statistical observational constraints. With planetary population synthesis, the theory of planet formation and evolution can be put to the test against these constraints. In this review of planetary population synthesis, we first briefly list key observational constraints. Then, the work flow in the method and its two main components are presented, namely global end-to-end models that predict planetary system properties directly from protoplanetary disk properties and probability distributions for these initial conditions. An overview of various population synthesis models in the literature is given. The sub-models for the physical processes considered in global models are described: the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, the planets' accretion of solids and gas, orbital migration, and N-body interactions among concurrently growing protoplanets. Next, typical population synthesis results are illustrated in the form of new syntheses obtained with the latest generation of the Bern model. Planetary formation tracks, the distribution of planets in the mass-distance and radius-distance plane, the planetary mass function, and the distributions of planetary radii, semimajor axes, and luminosities are shown, linked to underlying physical processes, and compared with their observational counterparts. We finish by highlighting the most important predictions made by population synthesis models and discuss the lessons learned from these predictions - both those later observationally confirmed and those rejected.},

  abstract = {Context. Observations have revealed in the Kepler data a depleted region separating smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes. This can be explained as an evaporation valley between planets with and without H/He that is caused by atmospheric escape. Aims. We want to analytically derive the valley's locus and understand how it depends on planetary properties and stellar X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) luminosity. We also want to derive constraints for planet formation models. Methods. First, we conducted numerical simulations of the evolution of close-in low-mass planets with H/He undergoing escape. We performed parameter studies with grids in core mass and orbital separation, and we varied the postformation H/He mass, the strength of evaporation, and the atmospheric and core composition. Second, we developed an analytical model for the valley locus. Results. We find that the bottom of the valley quantified by the radius of the largest stripped core, Rbare, at a given orbital distance depends only weakly on postformation H/He mass. The reason is that a high initial H/He mass means that more gas needs to evaporate, but also that the planet density is lower, increasing mass loss. Regarding the stellar XUV-luminosity, Rbare is found to scale as LXUV0.135. The same weak dependency applies to the efficiency factor {$\epsilon$} of energy-limited evaporation. As found numerically and analytically, Rbare varies a function of orbital period P for a constant {$\epsilon$} as P-2pc\$\textbackslash backslash\$3 {$\approx$} P-0.18, where Mc Rcpc is the mass-radius relation of solid cores. We note that Rbare is about 1.7 RO at a ten-day orbital period for an Earth-like composition. Conclusions. The numerical results are explained very well with the analytical model where complete evaporation occurs if the temporal integral over the stellar XUV irradiation that is absorbed by the planet is larger than the binding energy of the envelope in the gravitational potential of the core. The weak dependency on the postformation H/He means that the valley does not strongly constrain gas accretion during formation. But the weak dependency on primordial H/He mass, stellar LXUV, and {$\epsilon$} could be the reason why the valley is so clearly visible observationally, and why various models find similar results theoretically. At the same time, given the large observed spread of LXUV, the dependency on it is still strong enough to explain why the valley is not completely empty.},

We targeted quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that lie in the fields of view of the Kepler/K2 campaigns. Based on those observations , we report the discovery and properties of a previously unidentified instrumental signature in K2. Systematic errors in K2, beyond those due to the motion of the detector, plague our AGN and other faint-target, guest-observer science proposals. Weakly illuminated pixels are dominated by low frequency trends that are both non-astrophysical and correlated from object to object. A critical clue to understanding this instrumental noise is that different targets observed in the same channels of Campaign 8 (rear facing) and Campaign 16 (forward facing) had nearly identical light curves after time reversal of one of the campaigns. This observation strongly suggests that the underlying problem relates to the relative Sun-spacecraft-field orientation, which was approximately the same on day 1 of Campaign 8 as the last day of Campaign 16. Furthermore, we measure that the instrumental signature lags in time as a function of radius from the center of the detector, crossing channel boundaries. Systematics documented in this investigation are unlikely to be due to Moir\'e noise, rolling band, or pointing jitter. Instead this work strongly suggests temperature-dependent focus changes that are further subject to channel variations. Further characterization of this signature is crucial for rehabilitating K2 data for use in investigations of AGN light curves.},

We investigate if divergent migration is a viable mechanism for forming gaps in young debris disks with planets of low enough mass to currently elude detection. We perform numerical integrations of planet pairs embedded in planetesimal disks to assess the conditions for which divergent, planetesimal-driven migration occurs and gaps form within the disk. Gap widths and the migration rate of planets within a pair depend on both disk mass and the degree to which the planets share disk material. We find that planet pairs with planets more massive than Neptune can produce gaps with widths similar to their orbit distance within 10 Myr at orbit separations probed by direct imaging campaigns. Pairs of migrating super-Earths likely cannot form observable gaps on the same time and distance scales, however. Inferring the responsible planet masses from these gaps while neglecting migration could overestimate the mass of planets by more than an order of magnitude.},

Frequency analyses are very important in astronomy today, not least in the ever-growing field of exoplanets, where short-period signals in stellar radial velocity data are investigated. Periodograms are the main (and powerful) tools for this purpose. However, recovering the correct frequencies and assessing the probability of each frequency is not straightforward. Aims. We provide a formalism that is easy to implement in a code, to describe a Bayesian periodogram that includes weights and a constant offset in the data. The relative probability between peaks can be easily calculated with this formalism. We discuss the differences and agreements between the various periodogram formalisms with simulated examples. Methods. We used the Bayesian probability theory to describe the probability that a full sine function (including weights derived from the errors on the data values and a constant offset) with a specific frequency is present in the data. Results. From the expression for our Baysian generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram (BGLS), we can easily recover the expression for the non-Bayesian version. In the simulated examples we show that this new formalism recovers the underlying periods better than previous versions. A Python-based code is available for the community.},

  abstract = {We model the subnebulae of Jupiter and Saturn wherein satellite accretion took place. We expect each giant planet subnebula to be composed of an optically thick (given gaseous opacity) inner region inside of the planet's centrifugal radius (where the specific angular momentum of the collapsing giant planet gaseous envelope achieves centrifugal balance, located at rCJ {$\sim$} 15RJ for Jupiter and rCS, {$\sim$} 22RS for Saturn) and an optically thin, extended outer disk out to a fraction of the planet's Roche-lobe (RH), which we choose to be {$\sim$}RH/5 (located at {$\sim$}150 RJ near the inner irregular satellites for Jupiter, and {$\sim$}200RS, near Phoebe for Saturn). This places Titan and Ganymede in the inner disk, Callisto and Iapetus in the outer disk, and Hyperion in the transition region. The inner disk is the leftover of the gas accreted by the protoplanet. The outer disk may result from the nebula gas flowing into the protoplanet during the time of giant planet gap-opening (or cessation of gas accretion). For the sake of specificity, we use a solar composition "minimum mass" model to constrain the gas densities of the inner and outer disks of Jupiter and Saturn (and also Uranus). Our model has Ganymede at a subnebula temperature of {$\sim$}250 K and Titan at {$\sim$}100 K. The outer disks of Jupiter and Saturn have constant temperatures of 130 and 90 K, respectively. Our model has Callisto forming in a time scale {$\sim$}106 years, Iapetus in 106-107 years, Ganymede in 103-104 years, and Titan in 104-105 years. Callisto takes much longer to form than Ganymede because it draws materials from the extended, low density portion of the disk; its accretion time scale is set by the inward drift times of satellitesimals with sizes 300-500 km from distances {$\sim$}100RJ. This accretion history may be consistent with a partially differentiated Callisto with a {$\sim$}300-km clean ice outer shell overlying a mixed ice and rock-metal interior as suggested by Anderson et al. (2001), which may explain the Ganymede-Callisto dichotomy without resorting to fine-tuning poorly known model parameters. It is also possible that particulate matter coupled to the high specific angular momentum gas flowing through the gap after giant planet gap-opening, capture of heliocentric planetesimals by the extended gas disk, or ablation of planetesimals passing through the disk contributes to the solid content of the disk and lengthens the time scale for Callisto's formation. Furthermore, this model has Hyperion forming just outside Saturn's centrifugal radius, captured into resonance by proto-Titan in the presence of a strong gas density gradient as proposed by Lee and Peale (2000). While Titan may have taken significantly longer to form than Ganymede, it still formed fast enough that we would expect it to be fully differentiated. In this sense, it is more like Ganymede than like Callisto (Saturn's analog of Callisto, we expect, is Iapetus). An alternative starved disk model whose satellite accretion time scale for all the regular satellites is set by the feeding of planetesimals or gas from the planet's Roche-lobe after gap-opening is likely to imply a long accretion time scale for Titan with small quantities of NH3 present, leading to a partially differentiated (Callisto-like) Titan. The Cassini mission may resolve this issue conclusively. We briefly discuss the retention of elements more volatile than H2O as well as other issues that may help to test our model. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {With radii ranging between those of the Earth (1 Rearth) and Neptune ({$\sim$}3.9 Rearth), small planets constitute more than half of the inventory of the 4000-plus exoplanets discovered so far. This population follows a bimodal distribution peaking at {$\sim$}1.3 Rearth (super-Earths) and 2.4 Rearth (sub-Neptunes), with few planets in between. Smaller planets are sufficiently dense to be rocky, but those with radii larger than {$\sim$}1.6 Rearth are thought to display large amounts of volatiles, including in many cases hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes up to {$\sim$}30\% of the planetary mass. With orbital periods less than 100 days, these low-mass planets are highly irradiated and their origin, evolution, and possible links are still debated. Here we show that close-in ocean planets affected by greenhouse effect display hydrospheres in supercritical state, which generate inflated atmospheres without invoking the presence of large H/He gaseous envelopes. We derive a new set of mass-radius relationships for ocean planets with different compositions and different equilibrium temperatures, well adapted to low-density sub-Neptune planets. Our model suggests that super-Earths and sub-Neptunes could belong to the same family of planets. The differences between their interiors could simply result from the variation of the water content in those planets. Close-in sub-Neptunes would have grown from water-rich building blocks compared to super-Earths, and not concurrently from gas coming from the protoplanetary disk. This implies that small planets should present similar formation conditions, which resemble those known for the terrestrial and dwarf planets in the solar system.},

Cool dwarfs were chosen by collating parallax and proper motion catalogs from the literature and subjecting them to a variety of selection criteria. We calculate stellar parameters and TESS magnitudes using the best possible relations from the literature while maintaining uniformity of methods for the sake of reproducibility. We estimate the expected planet yield from TESS observations using statistical results from the Kepler Mission, and use these results to choose the best targets for two-minute observations, optimizing for small planets for which masses can conceivably be measured using follow up Doppler spectroscopy by current and future Doppler spectrometers. The catalog is incorporated into the TESS Input Catalog and TESS Candidate Target List until a more complete and accurate cool dwarf catalog identified by ESA's Gaia Mission can be incorporated.},

The cool star subsample allows characterization of small planets near the habitable zone, yet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around sun-like stars. In this paper, we show that occurrence rates of planets around M, K, G, and F stars observed with Kepler are significantly different from each other. We identify two trends with stellar mass: First, the occurrence of Earth to Neptune-sized planets (1 to 4 Earth radii) is successively higher towards cooler stars at all orbital periods probed by Kepler, confirming the result of Howard et al. (2012) and extending it down to Earth-sized planets; Second, a drop in occurrence rates towards the star is evident for all spectral types inwards of a {$\sim$}10 day orbital period, with a plateau further out. The distance from the star where this drop occurs depends on spectral type, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of stellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping and destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the pre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of migrating planets or planetary building blocks close to the star. These results demonstrate the stellar-mass dependence of the planet population \textendash{} both in terms of occurence rate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the inner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration of planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters.},

We derive the planet radius distribution function for Kepler stars of different spectral types, sampling a range in host star masses. We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets (1.0-2.8 R\_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer Neptune-sized and larger planets (\textbackslash textgreater2.8 R\_Earth). We find no systematic trend in the planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the increasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass-radius relationship and heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are independent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence rates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same mass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where Kepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average heavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with stellar mass from 4 M\_Earth in F stars to 5 M\_Earth in G and K stars to 7 M\_Earth in M stars. This trend stands in stark contrast with observed protoplanetary disk masses that decrease towards lower mass stars, and provides a challenge for current planet formation models. Neither models of in situ formation nor migration of fully-formed planets are consistent with these results. Instead, these results are indicative of large-scale inward migration of planetary building blocks \textemdash{} either through type-I migration or radial drift of dust grains \textemdash{} that is more efficient for lower mass stars, but does not result in significantly larger or smaller planets.},

Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42\% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au could be as high as 100\% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars of eta\_earth=36+-14\%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than {$\sim$}8\% and {$\sim$}3\% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.},

This chapter describes the observed relations between exoplanet populations and stellar properties and how they connect to planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Giant planets occur more frequently around more metal-rich and more massive stars. These findings support the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which the cores of giant planets form more rapidly in more metal-rich and more massive protoplanetary disks. Smaller planets, those with sizes roughly between Earth and Neptune, exhibit different scaling relations with stellar properties. These planets are found around stars with a wide range of metallicities and occur more frequently around lower-mass stars. This indicates that planet formation takes place in a wide range of environments, yet it is not clear why planets form more efficiently around low-mass stars. Going forward, exoplanet surveys targeting M dwarfs will characterize the exoplanet population around the lowest-mass stars. In combination with ongoing stellar characterization, this will help us understand the formation of planets in a large range of environments.},

These constraints can only be applied to planet formation models, however, if the observational biases and selection effects are properly accounted for. Here we show how epos, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, can be used to constrain planet formation models by comparing the Bern planet population synthesis models to the Kepler exoplanetary systems. We compile a series of diagnostics, based on occurrence rates of different classes of planets and the architectures of multi-planet systems, that can be used as benchmarks for future and current modeling efforts. Overall, we find that a model with 100 seed planetary cores per protoplanetary disk provides a reasonable match to most diagnostics. Based on these diagnostics we identify physical properties and processes that would result in the Bern model more closely matching the known planetary systems. These are: moving the planet trap at the inner disk edge outward; increasing the formation efficiency of mini-Neptunes; and reducing the fraction of stars that form observable planets. We conclude with an outlook on the composition of planets in the habitable zone, and highlight that the majority of simulated planets smaller than 1.7 Earth radii have substantial hydrogen atmospheres.

Unraveling the conditions needed to produce the observed exoplanet systems will allow us to make informed predictions as to where habitable worlds exist within the galaxy. In this paper, we examine using N-body simulations how the properties of planetary systems are determined during the final stages of assembly, when planets accrete from embryos and planetesimals. While accretion is a chaotic process, trends emerge allowing certain features of an ensemble of planetary systems to provide a memory of the initial distribution of solid mass around a star prior to accretion. We also use EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to account for detection biases and show that different accretion scenarios can be distinguished from observations of the Kepler systems. We show that the period of the innermost planet, the ratio of orbital periods of adjacent planets, and masses of the planets are determined by the total mass and radial distribution of embryos and planetesimals at the beginning of accretion. In general, some amount of orbital damping, either via planetesimals or gas, during accretion is needed to match the whole population of exoplanets. Surprisingly, all simulated planetary systems have planets that are similar in size, showing that the "peas in a pod" pattern can be consistent with both a giant impact scenario and a planet migration scenario. The inclusion of material at distances larger than what Kepler observes (1 au) has a profound impact on the observed planetary architectures, and thus on the formation and delivery of volatiles to possible habitable worlds.},

We use a pebble drift and accretion model to simulate the growth of planet cores inside and outside of the snow line. A smaller pebble size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 M {$\odot$} and for a range of initial disk masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets are anticorrelated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial-velocity surveys. A key testable prediction of the pebble accretion hypothesis is that the occurrence rates of super-Earths should decrease again for M dwarfs near the substellar boundary like Trappist-1.},

First, using photons from an M dwarf in its quiescent non-flaring state, we find that PS on an M dwarf planet in the HZ of its parent star is less effective than on Earth by a factor of 10 for a flare star with mid-M spectral type. For a flare star with late-M spectral type, PS effectiveness is smaller than on Earth by a factor of 100 or more. Second, using photons which are incident on the HZ planet during flares, we find that PS effectiveness can increase by factors of 5-20 above the quiescent values. In the case of a flare star with mid-M spectral type, we find that the PS effectiveness during a flare can increase up to as much as 50-60 percent of the values on Earth. However, for a late-M flare star, even during flares, the PS effectiveness remains almost one order of magnitude smaller than on Earth. We suggest that for biological processes on M dwarf planets, the stellar activity cycle may replace the orbital period as the year.},

  abstract = {We present a semi-analytical population synthesis model of protoplanetary clumps formed by disk instability at radial distances of 80 - 120 AU. Various clump density profiles, initial mass functions, protoplanetary disk models, stellar masses, and gap opening criteria are considered. When we use more realistic gap opening criteria, we find that gaps open only rarely which strongly affects clump survival rates and their physical properties (mass, radius and radial distance). The inferred surviving population is then shifted towards less massive clumps at smaller radial distances. We also find that populations of surviving clumps are very sensitive to the model assumptions and used parameters. Depending on the chosen parameters, the protoplanets occupy a mass range between 0.01 and 16 \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashtext\{J\}\}\$ and may either orbit close to the central star or as far out as 75 AU, with a sweet spot at 10-30 AU for the massive ones. However, in all the cases we consider we find that massive giant planets at very large radial distances are rare in qualitative agreement with current direct imaging surveys. We conclude that caution should be taken in deriving population synthesis models as well as when comparing the models' results with observations.},

This Southern Hemisphere facility operates as part of SPECULOOS, an international network of 1m-class telescopes surveying for transiting terrestrial planets around the nearest and brightest ultra-cool dwarfs. To automatically and efficiently process the observations of SPECULOOS-South, and to deal with the specialised photometric requirements of ultra-cool dwarf targets, we present our automatic pipeline. This pipeline includes an algorithm for automated differential photometry and an extensive correction technique for the effects of telluric water vapour, using ground measurements of the precipitable water vapour. Observing very red targets in the near-infrared can result in photometric systematics in the differential lightcurves, related to the temporally-varying, wavelength-dependent opacity of the Earth's atmosphere. These systematics are sufficient to affect the daily quality of the lightcurves, the longer time-scale variability study of our targets and even mimic transit-like signals. Here we present the implementation and impact of our water vapour correction method. Using the 179 nights and 98 targets observed in the I+z' filter by SPECULOOS-South since January 2019, we show the impressive photometric performance of the facility (with a median precision of {$\sim$}1.5 mmag for 30-min binning of the raw, non-detrended lightcurves) and assess its detection potential. We compare simultaneous observations with SPECULOOS-South and TESS, to show that we readily achieve high-precision, space-level photometry for bright, ultra-cool dwarfs, highlighting SPECULOOS-South as the first facility of its kind.},

In this work, we study the sticking and rolling of 1.1 mm ice grains at different temperatures. We find a strong increase in sticking between 175 K to 200 K which levels off at higher temperatures. In terms of surface energy this is an increase with a factor of 63.4, e.g. from \$\textbackslash backslashgamma = 0.0029 \textbackslash backslashrm J/m\^2\$ to \$\textbackslash backslashgamma = \textbackslash backslashrm 0.19 J/m\^2\$, respectively. We also measured critical forces for inelastic rolling. The critical rolling distance is constant with a value of 0.19 mm. In view of planetesimal formation at low temperatures in protoplanetary disks, the surface energy is not larger than for silicate dust and ice aggregation will share the same shortcommings. In general, water ice has no advantage over silicates for sticking and collisional growth might not favor ice over silicates.},

  abstract = {Context. The birth environments of planetary systems are thought to influence planet formation and orbital evolution, through external photoevaporation and stellar flybys. Recent work has claimed observational support for this, in the form of a correlation between the properties of planetary systems and the local Galactic phase space density of the host star. In particular, Hot Jupiters are found overwhelmingly around stars in regions of high phase space density, which may reflect a formation environment with high stellar density. Aims. We instead investigate whether the high phase density may have a galactic kinematic origin: Hot Jupiter hosts may be biased towards being young and therefore kinematically cold, because tidal inspiral leads to the destruction of the planets on Gyr timescales, and the velocity dispersion of stars in the Galaxy increases on similar timescales. Methods. We use 6D positions and kinematics from Gaia for the Hot Jupiter hosts and their neighbours, and construct distributions of the phase space density. We investigate correlations between the stars' local phase space density and peculiar velocity. Results. We find a strong anticorrelation between the phase space density and the host star's peculiar velocity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. Therefore, most stars in "high-density" regions are kinematically cold, which may be caused by the aforementioned bias towards detecting Hot Jupiters around young stars before the planets' tidal destruction. Conclusions. We do not find evidence in the data for Hot Jupiter hosts preferentially being in phase space overdensities compared to other stars, nor therefore for their originating in birth environments of high stellar density.},

The RV variations of GJ 4276 are best explained by the presence of a planetary companion that has a minimum mass of mb sin i 16 M on a Pb = 13.35 day orbit. The analysis of the activity indicators and spectral diagnostics exclude stellar induced RV perturbations and prove the planetary interpretation of the RV signal. We show that a circular single-planet solution can be excluded by means of a likelihood ratio test. Instead, we find that the RV variations can be explained either by an eccentric orbit or interpreted as a pair of planets on circular orbits near a period ratio of 2:1. Although the eccentric single-planet solution is slightly preferred, our statistical analysis indicates that none of these two scenarios can be rejected with high confidence using the RV time series obtained so far. Based on the eccentric interpretation, we find that GJ 4276 b is the most eccentric (eb = 0.37) exoplanet around an M dwarf with such a short orbital period known today.},

We reexamine settling and growth of dust particles in the subsequent laminar phase of the solar nebula in detail, treating a dust layer as a two-component fluid composed of the dust and the gas. We obtain analytic expressions for the settling path, the growing size, and the settling time. The settling process is divided into two phases, i.e., an early gas-dominant phase and a later dust-dominant phase. So far, only the former phase, where the particle path finally turns from vertical to radial, has been investigated. In the latter phase, dust particles drag the gas, rather than the gas does dust particles. Consequently, the particle path turns from radial to vertical. Dust particles grow most appreciably and rapidly in a radially sweeping phase. The final radii of dust particles at the onset of gravitational instability of the dust layer are 20, 5.9, and 0.60 cm in the Earth's, Jupiter's, and Neptune's zones, respectively. These values are much smaller than those obtained previously by S.J. Weidenschilling [1980, Icarus 44, 172-189] and Y. Nakagawa et al. [1981, Icarus 45, 517-528].

The axisymmetric gravitational stabilities of the disks are checked using Toomre's criterion. The resulting disk surface temperature distribution, (d log Ts/d log R) approximately = -0.6 (R is the cylindrical radius), can be attributed to two heating sources: the viscous heating dominant in the inner disk region, and the accretion shock heating dominant in the outer disk region. This surface temperature distribution matches that observed in many disks around young stellar objects. During the infall stage, disks with alpha less than 10-1.5 become gravitationally unstable independent of omega. The gravitational instabilities occur at radii ranging from 5 to 40 AU. The ratio of the disk mass to the central star mass ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 at the times of instability, about 4 x 10-5 x (omega/10-14/s)-0.67 yr.

To investigate how selection bias may contribute to this clustering, we consider 14 ETNOs discovered by the Dark Energy Survey, the Outer Solar System Origins Survey, and the survey of Sheppard and Trujillo. Using each survey's published pointing history, depth, and TNO tracking selections, we calculate the joint probability that these objects are consistent with an underlying parent population with uniform distributions in \$\textbackslash backslashvarpi\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashOmega\$. We find that the mean scaled longitude of perihelion and orbital poles of the detected ETNOs are consistent with a uniform population at a level between \$17\textbackslash backslash\%\$ and \$94\textbackslash backslash\%\$, and thus conclude that this sample provides no evidence for angular clustering.},

We studied the dependence of the observed properties of exoplanets (radius, mass, and orbital period) as a function of their host star metallicity. We analyzed the planetary radii and orbital periods of over 2800 Kepler candidates from the latest Kepler data release, DR25 (Q1\textendash Q17), with revised planetary radii based on Gaia DR2 as a function of host star metallicity (from the Q1\textendash Q17 (DR25) stellar and planet catalog). With a much larger sample and improved radius measurements, we are able to reconfirm previous results in the literature. We show that the average metallicity of the host star increases as the radius of the planet increases. We demonstrate this by first calculating the average host star metallicity for different radius bins and then supplementing these results by calculating the occurrence rate as a function of planetary radius and host star metallicity. We find a similar trend between host star metallicity and planet mass: the average host star metallicity increases with increasing planet mass. This trend, however, reverses for masses {$>$}4.0 MJ: host star metallicity drops with increasing planetary mass. We further examined the correlation between the host star metallicity and the orbital period of the planet.

In a recent first, an azimuthally elongated AU-scale blob, possibly a planet, was resolved with ALMA in TW Hya. The blob is at the edge of a cliff-like rollover in the dust disc rather than inside a dark ring. Here we build time-dependent models of TW Hya disc. We find that the classical paradigm cannot account for the morphology of the disc and the blob. We propose that ALMA-discovered blob hides a Neptune mass planet losing gas and dust. We show that radial drift of mm-sized dust particles naturally explains why the blob is located on the edge of the dust disc. Dust particles leaving the planet perform a characteristic U-turn relative to it, producing an azimuthally elongated blob-like emission feature. This scenario also explains why a 10 Myr old disc is so bright in dust continuum. Two scenarios for the dust-losing planet are presented. In the first, a dusty pre-runaway gas envelope of about 40 Earth mass Core Accretion planet is disrupted, e.g., as a result of a catastrophic encounter. In the second, a massive dusty pre-collapse gas giant planet formed by Gravitational Instability is disrupted by the energy released in its massive core. Future modelling may discriminate between these scenarios and allow us to study planet formation in an entirely new way \textendash{} by analysing the flows of dust and gas recently belonging to planets, informing us about the structure of pre-disruption planetary envelopes.},

  abstract = {The evolution of protoplanetary discs embedded in stellar clusters depends on the age and the stellar density in which they are embedded. Stellar clusters of young age and high stellar surface density destroy protoplanetary discs by external photoevaporation and stellar encounters. Here, we consider the effect of background heating from newly formed stellar clusters on the structure of protoplanetary discs and how it affects the formation of planets in these discs. Our planet formation model is built on the core accretion scenario, where we take the reduction of the core growth time-scale due to pebble accretion into account. We synthesize planet populations that we compare to observations obtained by radial velocity measurements. The giant planets in our simulations migrate over large distances due to the fast type-II migration regime induced by a high disc viscosity ({$\alpha$} = 5.4 \texttimes{} 10-3). Cold Jupiters (rp \textbackslash textgreater 1 au) originate preferably from the outer disc, due to the large-scale planetary migration, while hot Jupiters (rp \textbackslash textless 0.1 au) preferably form in the inner disc. We find that the formation of gas giants via pebble accretion is in agreement with the metallicity correlation, meaning that more gas giants are formed at larger metallicity. However, our synthetic population of isolated stars host a significant amount of giant planets even at low metallicity, in contradiction to observations where giant planets are preferably found around high metallicity stars, indicating that pebble accretion is very efficient in the standard pebble accretion framework. On the other hand, discs around stars embedded in cluster environments hardly form any giant planets at low metallicity in agreement with observations, where these changes originate from the increased temperature in the outer parts of the disc, which prolongs the core accretion time-scale of the planet. We therefore conclude that the outer disc structure and the planet's formation location determines the giant planet occurrence rate and the formation efficiency of cold and hot Jupiters.},

Small mass planets migrate in type I migration, while more massive planets migrate in type II migration, which is thought to depend mostly on the viscous evolution rate of the disc. A planet is most vulnerable to inward migration before it reaches type II migration and can lose a significant fraction of its semi-major axis at this stage. We investigated the influence of different disc viscosities, the dynamical torque and gas accretion from within the horseshoe region as mechanisms for slowing down planet migration. Our study confirms that planets growing in low viscosity environments migrate less, due to the earlier gap opening and slower type II migration rate. We find that taking the gas accretion from the horseshoe region into account allows an earlier gap opening and this results in less inward migration of growing planets. Furthermore, this effect increases the planetary mass compared to simulations that do not take the effect of gas accretion from the horseshoe region. Moreover, combining the effect of the dynamical torque with the effect of gas accretion from the horseshoe region, significantly slows down inward migration. Taking these effects into account could allow the formation of cold Jupiters (a \textbackslash textgreater 1 au) closer to the water ice line region compared to previous simulations that did not take these effects into account. We thus conclude that gas accretion from within the horseshoe region and the dynamical torque play crucial roles in shaping planetary systems.},

This work provides a framework for higher-dimensional studies of planet occurrence and for using mixture models to incorporate different theoretical populations of planets.},

This process is poorly understood, partly because we lack good observational constraints on the complex physical processes that contribute to planetesimal formation1. In the outer Solar System, the best place to look for clues is the Kuiper belt, where icy planetesimals survive to this day. Here we report evidence that Kuiper belt planetesimals formed by the streaming instability, a process in which aerodynamically concentrated clumps of pebbles gravitationally collapse into 100-kilometre-class bodies2. Gravitational collapse has previously been suggested to explain the ubiquity of equal-sized binaries in the Kuiper belt3\textendash 5. We analyse new hydrodynamical simulations of the streaming instability to determine the model expectations for the spatial orientation of binary orbits. The predicted broad inclination distribution with approximately 80\% of prograde binary orbits matches the observations of trans-Neptunian binaries6. The formation models that imply predominantly retrograde binary orbits (for example, ref. 7) can be ruled out. Given its applicability over a wide range of protoplanetary disk conditions8, it is expected that the streaming instability also seeded planetesimal formation elsewhere in the Solar System, and beyond.},

  abstract = {Planetesimals are compact astrophysical objects roughly 1-1000 km in size, massive enough to be held together by gravity. They can grow by accreting material to become full-size planets. Planetesimals themselves are thought to form by complex physical processes from small grains in protoplanetary disks. The streaming instability (SI) model states that mm/cm-size particles (pebbles) are aerodynamically collected into self-gravitating clouds which then directly collapse into planetesimals. Here we analyze ATHENA simulations of the SI to characterize the initial properties (e.g., rotation) of pebble clouds. Their gravitational collapse is followed with the PKDGRAV N-body code, which has been modified to realistically account for pebble collisions. We find that pebble clouds rapidly collapse into short-lived disk structures from which planetesimals form. The planetesimal properties depend on the cloud's scaled angular momentum, l=L/(M R\_H\^2 Omega, where L and M are the angular momentum and mass, R\_H is the Hill radius, and Omega is the orbital frequency. Low-l pebble clouds produce tight (or contact) binaries and single planetesimals. Compact high-l clouds give birth to binary planetesimals with attributes that closely resemble the equal-size binaries found in the Kuiper belt. Significantly, the SI-triggered gravitational collapse can explain the angular momentum distribution of known equal-size binaries \textendash{} a result pending verification from studies with improved resolution. About 10\% of collapse simulations produce hierarchical systems with two or more large moons. These systems should be found in the Kuiper belt when observations reach the threshold sensitivity.},

We use a new method that takes advantage of the HARPS high-resolution spectra to increase the precision of metallicity, using previous photometric calibrations of [Fe/H] and effective temperature as starting values. Results. In this work we use our new calibration (rms = 0.08 dex) to study the planet-metallicity relation of our sample. The well-known correlation for giant planet FGKM hosts with metallicity is present. Regarding Neptunians and smaller hosts no correlation is found but there is a hint that an anti-correlation with [Fe/H] may exist. We combined our sample with the California Planet Survey late-K and M-type dwarf sample to increase our statistics but found no new trends. We fitted a power law to the frequency histogram of the Jovian hosts for our sample and for the combined sample, f p = C10{$\alpha$} [Fe/H], using two different approaches: a direct bin fitting and a Bayesian fitting procedure. We obtained a value for C between 0.02 and 0.04 and for {$\alpha$} between 1.26 and 2.94. Regarding stellar mass, an hypothetical correlation with planets was discovered, but was found to be the result of a detection bias. \textcopyright{} 2013 ESO.},

  abstract = {Scientific integrity and consensus rely on the peer review process, a defining feature of scientific discourse that subjects the literature forming the foundation of credible knowledge in a scientific field to rigorous scrutiny. However, there is surprisingly little training in graduate school on how to develop this essential skill [Zimmerman et al., 2011] or discussion of best practices to ensure that reviewers at all levels efficiently provide the most useful review. Even more challenging for the novice peer reviewer is that journals also vary widely in their review guidelines. Nonetheless, the goals of peer review are crystal clear: to ensure the accuracy and improve the quality of published literature through constructive criticism. To make the peer review process as efficient and productive as possible, you may want to consider a few useful approaches to tackling major steps throughout your review, from contemplating a review request and reading and assessing the manuscript to writing the review and interacting with the journal's editors (see Figure 1). These tips are particularly relevant for graduate students or other first-time reviewers, but they may also be useful to experienced reviewers and to journal editors seeking to enhance their publication's processes.},

  abstract = {We analyse N-body simulations of star-forming regions to investigate the effects of external far and extreme ultraviolet photoevaporation from massive stars on proto-planetary discs. By varying the initial conditions of simulated star-forming regions, such as the spatial distribution, net bulk motion (virial ratio), and density, we investigate which parameters most affect the rate at which discs are dispersed due to external photoevaporation. We find that disc dispersal due to external photoevapo-ration is faster in highly substructured star-forming regions than in smooth and centrally concentrated regions. Sub-virial star-forming regions undergoing collapse also show higher rates of disc dispersal than regions that are in virial equilibrium or are expanding. In moderately dense ({$\sim$}100 M pc -3) regions, half of all protoplanetary discs with radii {$\geq$}100 AU are photoevaporated within 1 Myr, three times faster than is currently suggested by observational studies. Discs in lower-density star-forming regions ({$\sim$}10 M pc -3) survive for longer, but half are still dispersed on short timescales ({$\sim$}2 Myr). This demonstrates that the initial conditions of the star forming regions will greatly impact the evolution and lifetime of protoplanetary discs. These results also imply that either gas giant planet formation is extremely rapid and occurs before the gas component of discs is evaporated, or gas giants only form in low-density star-forming regions where no massive stars are present to photoevaporate gas from protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric retrieval of exoplanets from spectroscopic observations requires an extensive exploration of a highly degenerate and high-dimensional parameter space to accurately constrain atmospheric parameters. Retrieval methods commonly conduct Bayesian parameter estimation and statistical inference using sampling algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Nested Sampling. Recently several attempts have been made to use machine learning algorithms either to complement or replace fully Bayesian methods. While much progress has been made, these approaches are still at times unable to accurately reproduce results from contemporary Bayesian retrievals. The goal of our present work is to investigate the efficacy of machine learning for atmospheric retrieval. As a case study, we use the Random Forest supervised machine learning algorithm which has been applied previously with some success for atmospheric retrieval of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using its near-infrared transmission spectrum. We reproduce previous results using the same approach and the same semi-analytic models, and subsequently extend this method to develop a new algorithm that results in a closer match to a fully Bayesian retrieval. We combine this new method with a fully numerical atmospheric model and demonstrate excellent agreement with a Bayesian retrieval of the transmission spectrum of another hot Jupiter, HD 209458b. Despite this success, and achieving high computational efficiency, we still find that the machine learning approach is computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional parameter spaces that are routinely explored with Bayesian retrievals with modest computational resources. We discuss the trade offs and potential avenues for the future.},

  abstract = {Context. Methods used to detect giant exoplanets can be broadly divided into two categories: indirect and direct. Indirect methods are more sensitive to planets with a small orbital period, whereas direct detection is more sensitive to planets orbiting at a large distance from their host star. This dichotomy makes it difficult to combine the two techniques on a single target at once. Aims. Simultaneous measurements made by direct and indirect techniques offer the possibility of determining the mass and luminosity of planets and a method of testing formation models. Here, we aim to show how long-baseline interferometric observations guided by radial-velocity can be used in such a way. Methods. We observed the recently-discovered giant planet {$\beta$} Pictoris c with GRAVITY, mounted on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Results. This study constitutes the first direct confirmation of a planet discovered through radial velocity. We find that the planet has a temperature of T = 1250 {$\pm$} 50 K and a dynamical mass of M = 8.2 {$\pm$} 0.8 M Jup . At 18.5 {$\pm$} 2.5 Myr, this puts {$\beta$} Pic c close to a `hot start' track, which is usually associated with formation via disk instability. Conversely, the planet orbits at a distance of 2.7 au, which is too close for disk instability to occur. The low apparent magnitude ( M K = 14.3 {$\pm$} 0.1) favours a core accretion scenario. Conclusions. We suggest that this apparent contradiction is a sign of hot core accretion, for example, due to the mass of the planetary core or the existence of a high-temperature accretion shock during formation.},

Recent observations suggest that some exoplanets, e.g., Wasp 12-b, have atmospheric C/O ratios substantially different from the solar value of 0.54. In this Letter, we present a mechanism that can produce such atmospheric deviations from the stellar C/O ratio. In protoplanetary disks, different snowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon monoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas and in the condensed phases. In particular, between the H2O and CO snowlines most oxygen is present in icy grains - the building blocks of planetary cores in the core accretion model - while most carbon remains in the gas phase. This region is coincidental with the giant-planet-forming zone for a range of observed protoplanetary disks. Based on standard core accretion models of planet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from disk gas outside of the water snowline will have a C/O {$\sim$} 1, while atmospheres significantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have a stellar or substellar C/O when formed at the same disk radius. The overall metallicity will also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may therefore provide constraints on where and how a specific planet formed. \textcopyright{} 2011.

  abstract = {Molecular D/H ratios are frequently used to probe the chemical past of Solar System volatiles. Yet it is unclear which parts of the Solar Nebula hosted an active deuterium fractionation chemistry. To address this question, we present 0".2-0".4 ALMA observations of DCO+ and DCN 2-1, 3-2 and 4-3 towards the nearby protoplanetary disk around TW Hya, taken as part of the TW Hya Rosetta Stone project, augmented with archival data. DCO+ is characterized by an excitation temperature of {$\sim$}40 K across the 70 au radius pebble disk, indicative of emission from a warm, elevated molecular layer. Tentatively, DCN is present at even higher temperatures. Both DCO+ and DCN present substantial emission cavities in the inner disk, while in the outer disk the DCO+ and DCN morphologies diverge: most DCN emission originates from a narrow ring peaking around 30{$\sim$}au, with some additional diffuse DCN emission present at larger radii, while DCO+ is present in a broad structured ring that extends past the pebble disk. Based on parametric disk abundance models, these emission patterns can be explained by a near-constant DCN abundance exterior to the cavity, and an increasing DCO+ abundance with radius. There appears to be an active deuterium fractionation chemistry in multiple disk regions around TW Hya, but not in the cold planetesimal-forming midplane and in the inner disk. More observations are needed to explore whether deuterium fractionation is actually absent in these latter regions, and if its absence is a common feature, or something peculiar to the old TW Hya disk.},

The chemical compositions of these planet-forming disks regulate all aspects of planetary compositions from bulk elemental inventories to access to water and reactive organics, i.e. a planet's hospitality to life and its chemical origins. Disk chemical structures are in their turn governed by a combination of \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it in situ\} chemical processes, and inheritance of molecules from the preceding evolutionary stages of the star formation process. In this review we present our current understanding of the chemical processes active in pre- and protostellar environments that set the initial conditions for disks, and the disk chemical processes that evolve the chemical conditions during the first million years of planet formation. We review recent observational, laboratory and theoretical discoveries that have led to the present view of the chemical environment within which planets form, and their effects on the compositions of nascent planetary systems. We also discuss the many unknowns that remain and outline some possible pathways to addressing them.},

  abstract = {The Pan-Planets survey observed an area of 42 sq deg. in the galactic disk for about 165 hours. The main scientific goal of the project is the detection of transiting planets around M dwarfs. We establish an efficient procedure for determining the stellar parameters \$T\_\{eff\}\$ and log\$g\$ of all sources using a method based on SED fitting, utilizing a three-dimensional dust map and proper motion information. In this way we identify more than 60000 M dwarfs, which is by far the largest sample of low-mass stars observed in a transit survey to date. We present several planet candidates around M dwarfs and hotter stars that are currently being followed up. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we calculate the detection efficiency of the Pan-Planets survey for different stellar and planetary populations. We expect to find \$3.0\^\{+3.3\}\_\{-1.6\}\$ hot Jupiters around F, G, and K dwarfs with periods lower than 10 days based on the planet occurrence rates derived in previous surveys. For M dwarfs, the percentage of stars with a hot Jupiter is under debate. Theoretical models expect a lower occurrence rate than for larger main sequence stars. However, radial velocity surveys find upper limits of about 1\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% due to their small sample, while the Kepler survey finds a occurrence rate that we estimate to be at least \$0.17(\^\{+0.67\}\_\{-0.04\})\$\%, making it even higher than the determined fraction from OGLE-III for F, G and K stellar types, \$0.14(\^\{+0.15\}\_\{-0.076\})\textbackslash backslash\%\$. With the large sample size of Pan-Planets, we are able to determine an occurrence rate of \$0.11(\^\{+0.37\}\_\{-0.02\})\$\% in case one of our candidates turns out to be a real detection. If, however, none of our candidates turn out to be true planets, we are able to put an upper limit of 0.34\% with a 95\% confidence on the hot Jupiter occurrence rate of M dwarfs. Therefore we cannot yet confirm the theoretical prediction of a lower occurrence rate for cool stars.},

  abstract = {Hot Jupiters seem to get rarer with decreasing stellar mass. The goal of the Pan-Planets transit survey was the detection of such planets and a statistical characterization of their frequency. Here, we announce the discovery and validation of two planets found in that survey, Wendelstein-1b and Wendelstein-2b, which are two short-period hot Jupiters that orbit late K host stars. We validated them both by the traditional method of radial velocity measurements with the HIgh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) instruments and then by their Transit Color Signature (TraCS). We observed the targets in the wavelength range of \$4000 - 24000\$ Angstr\$\textbackslash backslash\$"om and performed a simultaneous multiband transit fit and additionally determined their thermal emission via secondary eclipse observations. Wendelstein-1b is a hot Jupiter with a radius of \$1.0314\_\{-0.0061\}\^\{+0.0061\}\$ \$R\_J\$ and mass of \$0.592\_\{-0.129\}\^\{+0.165\}\$ \$M\_J\$, orbiting a K7V dwarf star at a period of \$2.66\$ d, and has an estimated surface temperature of about \$1727\_\{-90\}\^\{+78\}\$ K.

  abstract = {A substantial number of super-Earths have been discovered, and atmospheres of transiting super-Earths have also been observed by transmission spectroscopy. Several lines of observational evidence indicate that most super-Earths do not possess massive H 2 /He atmospheres. However, accretion and retention of less massive atmospheres on super-Earths challenge planet formation theory. We consider the following three mechanisms: (i) envelope heating by pebble accretion, (ii) mass loss during giant impacts, and (iii) atmospheric loss by stellar X-ray and EUV photoevaporation. We investigate whether these mechanisms influence the amount of the atmospheres that form around super-Earths. We develop a code combining an N-body simulation of pebble-driven planetary formation and an atmospheric evolution simulation. We demonstrate that the observed orbital properties of super-Earths are well reproduced by the results of our simulations. However, (i) heating by pebble accretion ceases prior to disk dispersal, (ii) the frequency of giant impact events is too low to sculpt massive atmospheres, and (iii) many super-Earths having H 2 /He atmospheres of 10 wt\% survive against stellar irradiations for 1 Gyr. Therefore, it is likely that other mechanisms such as suppression of gas accretion are required to explain less massive atmospheres (10 wt\%) of super-Earths.},

  abstract = {Context: The long-term carbonate-silicate cycle plays an important role in the evolution of Earth's climate and, therefore, may also be an important mechanism in the evolution of the climates of Earth-like exoplanets. Aims: We investigate the effects of radiogenic mantle heating, core size, and planetary mass on the evolution of the atmospheric partial \$CO\_2\$ pressure, and the ability of a long-term carbon cycle driven by plate tectonics to control the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. Methods: We developed a box-model which connects carbon cycling to parametrized mantle convection. The carbon cycle was coupled to the thermal evolution via the plate speed, which depends on the global Rayleigh number. Results: We find decreasing atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure with time, up to an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. Higher abundances of radioactive isotopes result in higher \$CO\_2\$ pressures. We find a decreasing Rayleigh number and plate speed toward planets with larger core mass fractions \$f\_c\$, which leads to lower atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. More massive planets may favor the development of more \$CO\_2\$ rich atmospheres due to hotter interiors. Conclusions: The dependence of plate tectonics on mantle cooling has a significant effect on the long-term evolution of the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. Carbon cycling mediated by plate tectonics is efficient in regulating planetary climates for a wide range of mantle radioactive isotope abundances, planet masses and core sizes. More efficient carbon cycling on planets with a high mantle abundance of thorium or uranium highlights the importance of mapping the abundances of these elements in host stars of potentially habitable exoplanets. Inefficient carbon recycling on planets with a large core mass fraction (\$f\_c\textbackslash backslashgtrsim 0.8\$) emphasizes the importance of precise mass-radius measurements of Earth-sized exoplanets.},

  abstract = {Planetary bodies form by accretion of smaller bodies. It has been suggested that a very efficient way to grow protoplanets is by accreting particles of size {$\ll$} km (e.g., chondrules, boulders, or fragments of larger bodies) as they can be kept dynamically cold. We investigate the effects of gas drag on the impact radii and the accretion rates of these particles. As simplifying assumptions we restrict our analysis to 2D settings, a gas drag law linear in velocity, and a laminar disk characterized by a smooth (global) pressure gradient that causes particles to drift in radially. These approximations, however, enable us to cover an arbitrary large parameter space. The framework of the circularly restricted three body problem is used to numerically integrate particle trajectories and to derive their impact parameters. Three accretion modes can be distinguished: hyperbolic encounters, where the 2-body gravitational focusing enhances the impact parameter; three-body encounters, where gas drag enhances the capture probability; and settling encounters, where particles settle towards the protoplanet. An analysis of the observed behavior is presented; and we provide a recipe to analytically calculate the impact radius, which confirms the numerical findings. We apply our results to the sweepup of fragments by a protoplanet at a distance of 5 AU. Accretion of debris on small protoplanets ({$\lessequivlnt$}50 km) is found to be slow, because the fragments are distributed over a rather thick layer. However, the newly found settling mechanism, which is characterized by much larger impact radii, becomes relevant for protoplanets of {$\sim$}103 km in size and provides a much faster channel for growth. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2010.},

The configuration confounds theorists as the planets are not easily explained by either in situ or migration models. In this paper we present a scenario for the formation and orbital architecture of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In our model, planet formation starts at the H2O iceline, where pebble-sized particles whose origin is the outer disk accumulate to trigger streaming instabilities. After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by pebble accretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet's gravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets are transported by type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall at the magnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. During disk dispersal, the cavity radius expands and the innermost planets escape resonance. We argue that the model outlined here can also be applied to other compact systems and that the many close-in super-Earth systems are a scaled-up version of TRAPPIST-1. We also hypothesize that few close-in compact systems harbor giant planets at large distances, since they would have stopped the pebble flux from the outer disk.},

In pebble accretion , accretion occurs by settling and depends only on the mass of the gravitating body , not its radius. I give the conditions under which pebble accretion operates and show that the collisional cross section can become much larger than in the gas-free, ballistic, limit. In particular, pebble accretion requires the pre-existence of a massive planetesimal seed. When pebbles experience strong orbital decay by drift motions or are stirred by turbulence, the accretion efficiency is low and a great number of pebbles are needed to form Earth-mass cores. Pebble accretion is in many ways a more natural and versatile process than the classical, planetesimal-driven paradigm, opening up avenues to understand planet formation in solar and exoplanetary systems.},

  abstract = {During their formation, planets form large, hot atmospheres due to the ongoing accretion of solids. It has been customary to assume that all solids end up at the center constituting a "core" of refractory materials, whereas the envelope remains metal-free. Recent work, as well as observations by the JUNO mission, indicate however that the distinction may not be so clear cut. Indeed, small silicate, pebble-sized particles will sublimate in the atmosphere when they hit the sublimation temperature (T {$\sim$} 2000 K). In this paper we extend previous analytical work to compute the properties of planets under such a pebble accretion scenario. We conduct 1D numerical calculations of the atmosphere of an accreting planet, solving the stellar structure equations, augmented by a non-ideal equation of state that describes a hydrogen/helium-silicate vapor mixture. Calculations terminate at the point where the total mass in metal equals that of the H/He gas, which we numerically confirm as the onset of runaway gas accretion. When pebbles sublimate before reaching the core, not enough (accretion) energy is available to mix dense, vapor-rich lower layers with the higher layers of lower metallicity. A gradual structure in which Z decreases with radius is therefore a natural outcome of planet formation by pebble accretion. We highlight, furthermore, that (small) pebbles can act as the dominant source of opacity, preventing rapid cooling and presenting a channel for (mini-)Neptunes to survive in gas-rich disks. Nevertheless, once pebble accretion subsides, the atmosphere rapidly clears followed by runaway gas accretion. We consider atmospheric recycling to be the more probable mechanisms that have stalled the growth of these planets' envelopes.},

The resulting mass-radius (M-R) diagram shows two distinct populations, corresponding to rocky and volatile-rich exoplanets which overlap in both mass and radius. The rocky exoplanet population shows a relatively small density variability and ends at mass of {$\sim$}25 M {$\oplus$} , possibly indicating the maximum core mass that can be formed. We use the composition line of pure water to separate the two populations, and infer two new empirical M-R relations based on this data: M = (0.9 {$\pm$} 0.06) R (3.45{$\pm$}0.12) for the rocky population, and M = (1.74 {$\pm$} 0.38) R (1.58{$\pm$}0.10) for the volatile-rich population.

We calculate evaporation rates by solving the hydrodynamical problem for planetary evaporation including heating from both X-ray and EUV radiation. We show that most close-in planets (a \textbackslash textless 0.1 au) are evaporating hydrodynamically, with the evaporation occurring in two distinct regimes: X-ray driven, in which the X-ray heated flow contains a sonic point, and EUV driven, in which the X-ray region is entirely sub-sonic. The mass-loss rates scale as LX/a2 for X-ray driven evaporation, and as{$\Phi$} *1/2/a for EUV driven evaporation at early times, with mass-loss rates of the order of 1010-1014 g s-1. No exact scaling exists for the mass-loss rate with planet mass and planet radius; however, in general evaporation proceeds more rapidly for planets with lower densities and higher masses. Furthermore, we find that in general the transition from X-ray driven to EUV driven evaporation occurs at lower X-ray luminosities for planets closer to their parent stars and for planets with lower densities. Coupling our evaporation models to the evolution of the high-energy radiation - which falls with time - we are able to follow the evolution of evaporating planets. We find that most planets start offevaporating in the X-ray driven regime, but switch to EUV driven once the X-ray luminosity falls below a critical value. The evolution models suggest that while 'hot Jupiters' are evaporating, they are not evaporating at a rate sufficient to remove the entire gaseous envelope on Gyr time-scales. However, we do find that close in Neptune mass planets are more susceptible to complete evaporation of their envelopes. Thus we conclude that planetary evaporation is more important for lower mass planets, particularly those in the 'hot Neptune'/'super Earth' regime.},

We present analytical scaling relations and derive estimates for the total mass-loss rates, as well as discussing the existence of similarity solutions for flows from primordial discs and discs with inner holes. Furthermore, we perform numerical calculations, which span a wide range of parameter space and allow us to provide accurate scalings of the mass-loss rates with the physical parameters of the systems (X-ray and FUV luminosity, stellar mass, disc mass, disc temperature and inner hole radius). The model suggest that the X-ray component dominates the photoevaporative mass-loss rates from the inner disc. The mass-loss rates have values in the range from 10e-11 to 10e-7 M\_sun/yr and scale linearly with X-ray luminosity, with only a weak dependence on the other parameters explored. However, in the case of high FUV to X-ray (L\_FUV/L\_X\textbackslash textgreater100) luminosity ratios, the FUV constricts the X-ray flow and may dominate the mass-loss. Simulations of low mass discs with inner holes demonstrate a further stage of disc clearing, which we call `thermal sweeping'. This process occurs when the mid-plane pressure drops to sufficiently low values. At this stage a bound, warm, X-ray heated region becomes sufficiently large and unstable, such that the remaining disc material is cleared on approximately dynamical time-scales. This process significantly reduces the time taken to clear the outer regions of the disc, resulting in an expected transition disc population that will be dominated by accreting objects, as indicated by recent observations.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the Kepler mission's planet discoveries, we consider the thermal contraction of planets close to their parent star, under the influence of evaporation. The mass-loss rates are based on hydrodynamic models of evaporation that include both X-ray and EUV irradiation. We find that only low mass planets with hydrogen envelopes are significantly affected by evaporation, with evaporation being able to remove massive hydrogen envelopes inward of {$\sim$}0.1 AU for Neptune-mass objects, while evaporation is negligible for Jupiter-mass objects. Moreover, most of the evaporation occurs in the first 100 Myr of stars' lives when they are more chromospherically active. We construct a theoretical population of planets with varying core masses, envelope masses, orbital separations, and stellar spectral types, and compare this population with the sizes and densities measured for low-mass planets, both in the Kepler mission and from radial velocity surveys. This exercise leads us to conclude that evaporation is the driving force of evolution for close-in Kepler planets. In fact, some 50\% of the Kepler planet candidates may have been significantly eroded. Evaporation explains two striking correlations observed in these objects: a lack of large radius/low density planets close to the stars and a possible bimodal distribution in planet sizes with a deficit of planets around 2 R {$\oplus$}. Planets that have experienced high X-ray exposures are generally smaller than this size, and those with lower X-ray exposures are typically larger. A bimodal planet size distribution is naturally predicted by the evaporation model, where, depending on their X-ray exposure, close-in planets can either hold on to hydrogen envelopes {$\sim$}0.5\%-1\% in mass or be stripped entirely. To quantitatively reproduce the observed features, we argue that not only do low-mass Kepler planets need to be made of rocky cores surrounded with hydrogen envelopes, but few of them should have initial masses above 20 M {$\oplus$} and the majority of them should have core masses of a few Earth masses. \textcopyright{} 2013.

  abstract = {The photoevaporation model is one of the leading explanations for the evolution of small, close-in planets and the origin of the radius-valley. However, without planet mass measurements, it is challenging to test the photoevaporation scenario. Even if masses are available for individual planets, the host star's unknown EUV/X-ray history makes it difficult to assess the role of photoevaporation. We show that systems with multiple transiting planets are the best in which to rigorously test the photoevaporation model. By scaling one planet to another in a multi-transiting system, the host star's uncertain EUV/X-ray history can be negated. By focusing on systems that contain planets that straddle the radius-valley, one can estimate the minimum-masses of planets above the radius-valley (and thus are assumed to have retained a voluminous hydrogen/helium envelope). This minimum-mass is estimated by assuming that the planet below the radius-valley entirely lost its initial hydrogen/helium envelope, then calculating how massive any planet above the valley needs to be to retain its envelope. We apply this method to 104 planets above the radius gap in 73 systems for which precise enough radii measurements are available. We find excellent agreement with the photoevaporation model. Only two planets (Kepler - 100c \& 142c) appear to be inconsistent, suggesting they had a different formation history or followed a different evolutionary pathway to the bulk of the population. Our method can be used to identify TESS systems that warrant radial-velocity follow-up to further test the photoevaporation model.},

  abstract = {Volatile species in protoplanetary discs can undergo a phase change from vapour to solid. These "snow-lines" can play vital roles in planet formation at all scales, from dust coagulation to planetary migration. In the outer regions of protoplanetary discs, the temperature profile is set by the absorption of reprocessed stellar light by the solids. Further, the temperature profile sets the distribution of solids through sublimation and condensation at various snow-lines. Hence the snow-line position depends on the temperature profile and vice-versa. We show that this coupling can be thermally unstable, such that a patch of the disc at a snow-line will produce either run-away sublimation or condensation. This thermal instability arises at moderate optical depths, where heating by absorption of reprocessed stellar light from the disc's atmosphere is optically thick, yet cooling is optically thin. Since volatiles in the solid phase drift much faster than volatiles in the vapour phase, this thermal instability results in a limit-cycle. The snow-line progressively moves in, condensing volatiles, before receding, as the volatiles sublimate. Using numerical simulations, we study the evolution of the CO snow-line. We find the CO snow-line is thermally unstable under typical disc conditions and evolves inwards from \$\textbackslash backslashsim50\$ to \$\textbackslash backslashsim30\${$\sim$}AU on timescales from 1,000-10,000 years. The CO snow-line spends between \$\textbackslash backslashsim 10\textbackslash backslash\%-50\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of its time at smaller separations, where the exact value is sensitive to the total opacity and turbulent viscosity. The evolving snow-line also creates ring-like structures in the solid distribution interior to the snow-line. Multiple ring-like structures created by moving snow-lines could potentially explain the sub-structures seen in many \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it ALMA\} images.},

We investigate the conditions for dust-gap formation in terms of particle size and planetary mass. We also monitor the amount of dust that is accreted by the planet relative to the amount of gas, which is an important parameter in determining the enrichment of solids in giant planets compared to the solid content of the central star. Methods. We use a new two-fluid hydrodynamics code to solve the flow equations for both gas and dust. For the gas, we use a Godunov-type scheme with an approximate Riemann solver (the Roe solver). The dust is treated as a pressureless fluid by essentially the same numerical method as is used for the gas. Results. We find that it only takes a planet of 0.05 Jupiter masses to open up a gap in a disk with a significant population of mm-sized particles. Dust particles larger than 150 {$\mu$}m participate in gap formation. We also find that the formation of the gap severely slows down dust accretion compared to that in the gas. Therefore, it is not possible to enrich a newly formed giant planet in solids, if these solids are contained in particles with sizes from 150 {$\mu$}m to approximately 10 cm. \textcopyright{} ESO 2006.},

In the limit of very strong diffusion, the linear corotation torque is recovered. For the case of thermal diffusion, this limit corresponds to having a locally isothermal equation of state.

However, not all interesting TESS planets orbit around bright host stars. TOI-263b is a validated ultra-short period substellar object in a 0.56-day orbit around a faint (V=18.97) M3.5 dwarf star. The substellar nature of TOI-263b was explored using multi-color photometry, which determined a true radius of 0.87+-0.21 Rj, establishing TOI-263b's nature ranging from an inflated Neptune to a brown dwarf. The orbital period-radius parameter space occupied by TOI-263b is quite unique, which prompted a further characterization of its true nature. Here, we report radial velocity measurements of TOI-263 obtained with 3 VLT units and the ESPRESSO spectrograph to retrieve the mass of TOI-263b. We find that TOI-263b is a brown dwarf with a mass of 61.6+-4.0 Mj. Additionally, the orbital period of the brown dwarf is found to be synchronized with the rotation period of the host star, and the system is found to be relatively active, possibly revealing a star\textendash brown dwarf interaction. All these findings suggest that the system's formation history might be explained via disc fragmentation and later migration to close-in orbits. If the system is found to be unstable, TOI-263 is an excellent target to test the migration mechanisms before the brown dwarf becomes engulfed by its parent star.},

Attention is given to the situation when the surface density of the disk changes on a scale length comparable to its thickness in a gap region, of comparable dimensions, containing the protoplanet. In this case it is necessary to solve for the tidal perturbations taking the surface density structure fully into account. Expressions are developed for the angular momentum exchange rate between protoplanet and disk that require simple numerical calculations only. These calculations are undertaken for simple polytropic models of the disk. The behavior of the tidal perturbation under a wide range of assumptions about dissipation in the disk is considered, and the methods are applied to calculate the strength of the tidal torque in the limit that the protoplanet is sufficiently massive to induce a gap in the nebula.},

  abstract = {Star and planet formation are inextricably linked. In the earliest phases of the collapse of a protostar, a disc forms around the young star and such discs are observed for the first several million years of a star's life. It is within these circumstellar, or protoplanetary, discs that the first stages of planet formation occur. Recent observations from the Atacama large millimetre array (ALMA) suggest that planet formation may already be underway after only 1 Myr of a star's life. However, stars do not form in isolation; they form from the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds several parsecs in size. This results in young stars forming in groups - often referred to as 'clusters'. In these star-forming regions, the stellar density is much higher than the location of the Sun and other stars in the Galactic disc that host exoplanets. As such, the environment where stars form has the potential to influence the planet formation process. In star-forming regions, protoplanetary discs can be truncated or destroyed by interactions with passing stars, as well as photoevaporation from the radiation fields of very massive stars. Once formed, the planets themselves can have their orbits altered by dynamical encounters - either directly from passing stars or through secondary effects such as the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In this contribution, I review the different processes that can affect planet formation and stability in star-forming regions. I discuss each process in light of the typical range of stellar densities observed for star-forming regions. I finish by discussing these effects in the context of theories for the birth environment of the Solar System.},

  abstract = {Many theoretical studies have shown that external photoevaporation from massive stars can severely truncate, or destroy altogether, the gaseous protoplanetary discs around young stars. In tandem, several observational studies report a correlation between the mass of a protoplanetary disc and its distance to massive ionising stars in star-forming regions, and cite external photoevaporation by the massive stars as the origin of this correlation. We present N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions and determine the mass-loss in protoplanetary discs from external photoevaporation due to far ultraviolet (FUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from massive stars. We find that projection effects can be significant, in that low-mass disc-hosting stars that appear close to the ionising sources may be fore- or background stars in the star-forming region. We find very little evidence in our simulations for a trend in increasing disc mass with increasing distance from the massive star(s), even when projection effects are ignored. Furthermore, the dynamical evolution of these young star-forming regions moves stars whose discs have been photoevaporated to far-flung locations, away from the ionising stars, and we suggest that any correlation between disc mass and distance the ionising star is either coincidental, or due to some process other than external photoevaporation.},

However, only a fraction of these candidates will be legitimate planets, and the candidate validation will require a significant amount of follow-up resources. Radial velocity (RV) follow-up can be carried out only for the most promising candidates around bright, slowly rotating, stars. Thus, before devoting RV resources to candidates, they need to be vetted using cheaper methods, and, in the cases for which an RV confirmation is not feasible, the candidate's true nature needs to be determined based on these alternative methods alone. Aims. We study the applicability of multicolour transit photometry in the validation of transiting planet candidates when the candidate signal arises from a real astrophysical source (transiting planet, eclipsing binary, etc.), and not from an instrumental artefact. Particularly, we aim to answer how securely can we estimate the true uncontaminated star-planet radius ratio when the light curve may contain contamination from unresolved light sources inside the photometry aperture when combining multicolour transit observations with a physics-based contamination model in a Bayesian parameter estimation setting. More generally, we study how the contamination level, colour differences between the planet host and contaminant stars, transit signal-to-noise ratio, and available prior information affect the contamination and true radius ratio estimates. Methods. The study is based on simulations and ground-based multicolour transit observations. The contamination analyses are carried out with a contamination model integrated into the PyTransit v2 transit modelling package, and the observations are carried out with the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager installed in the 1.5 m Telescopio Carlos Sanchez in the Teide Observatory, Tenerife. Results. We show that multicolour transit photometry can be used to estimate the amount of flux contamination and the true radius ratio. Combining the true radius ratio with an estimate for the stellar radius yields the true absolute radius of the transiting object, which is a valuable quantity in statistical candidate validation, and enough in itself to validate a candidate whose radius falls below the theoretical lower limit for a brown dwarf.},

  abstract = {The disk mass is among the most important input parameter for every planet formation model to determine the number and masses of the planets that can form. We present an ALMA 887micron survey of the disk population around objects from 2 to 0.03Msun in the nearby 2Myr-old Chamaeleon I star-forming region. We detect thermal dust emission from 66 out of 93 disks, spatially resolve 34 of them, and identify two disks with large dust cavities of about 45AU in radius. Assuming isothermal and optically thin emission, we convert the 887micron flux densities into dust disk masses, hereafter Mdust. We find that the Mdust-Mstar relation is steeper than linear with power law indices 1.3-1.9, where the range reflects two extremes of the possible relation between the average dust temperature and stellar luminosity. By re-analyzing all millimeter data available for nearby regions in a self-consistent way, we show that the 1-3 Myr-old regions of Taurus, Lupus, and Chamaeleon I share the same Mdust-Mstar relation, while the 10Myr-old Upper Sco association has a steeper relation. Theoretical models of grain growth, drift, and fragmentation reproduce this trend and suggest that disks are in the fragmentation-limited regime. In this regime millimeter grains will be located closer in around lower-mass stars, a prediction that can be tested with deeper and higher spatial resolution ALMA observations.},

The only hot Jupiter for which orbital decay has been directly detected is WASP-12, for which transit timing measurements spanning more than a decade have revealed that the orbital period is decreasing at a rate of \$dP/dt\textbackslash backslashapprox 10\^\{-9\}\$, corresponding to a reduced tidal quality factor of about \$2\textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^5\$. Here, we present a compilation of transit-timing data for WASP-12 and eleven other systems which are especially favorable for detecting orbital decay: KELT-16; WASP-18, 19, 43, 72, 103, 114, and 122; HAT-P-23; HATS-18; and OGLE-TR-56. For most of these systems we present new data that extend the time baseline over which observations have been performed. None of the systems besides WASP-12 displays convincing evidence for period changes, with typical upper limits on \$dP/dt\$ on the order of \$10\^\{-9\}\$ or \$10\^\{-10\}\$, and lower limits on the reduced tidal quality factor on the order of \$10\^5\$. One possible exception is WASP-19, which shows a statistically significant trend, although it may be a spurious effect of starspot activity. Further observations are encouraged.},

  abstract = {Geostationary observations offer the unique opportunity to resolve the diurnal cycle of the Earth's Radiation Budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), crucial for climate-change studies. However, a drawback of the continuous temporal coverage of the geostationary orbit is the fixed viewing geometry. As a consequence, errors in the angular distribution models (ADMs) used in the radiance-to-flux conversion process can result in systematic errors of the estimated radiative fluxes. In this work, focusing on clear-sky reflected TOA observations, we compare the overlapping views from Meteosat Second Generation satellites at 0\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$deg\} and 41.5\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$deg\}E longitude which enable a quantification of viewing-angle-dependent differences. Using data derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), we identify some of the main sources of discrepancies, and show that they can be significantly reduced at the level of one month. This is achieved, separately for each satellite, via a masking procedure followed by an empirical fit at the pixel-level that takes into account all the clear-sky data from that satellite, calculated separately per timeslot of the day, over the month of November 2016. The method is then applied to each month of 2017, and gives a quadratic mean of the albedo root-mean squared difference over the dual-view region which is comparable from month to month, with a 2017 average value of 0.01. Sources of discrepancies include the difficulty to estimate the flux over the sunglint ocean region close to the limbs, the absence of dedicated angular distribution models for the aerosol-over-ocean case in the data processing, and the existence of an observer-dependent diurnal-asymmetry artefact affecting the clear-sky-albedo dependence on the solar zenith angle particularly over land areas.},

  abstract = {Transiting exoplanets in multi-planet systems exhibit non-Keplerian orbits as a result of the gravitational influence from companions which can cause the times and durations of transits to vary. The amplitude and periodicity of the transit time variations (TTV) are characteristic of the perturbing planet's mass and orbit. The objects of interest (TOI) from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite are analyzed in a uniform way to search for TTVs with sectors 1-3 of data. Based on an analysis of 74 planet-hosting stars from the TOI catalog an average photometric precision of {$\sim$}1000 ppm is measured for stars with magnitudes between {$\sim$}9\textendash 11. Due to the volume of targets in the TESS candidate list, artificial intelligence is used to expedite the search for planets by vetting non-transit signals prior to characterizing the light curve time series. The significance of a perturbing planet is assessed by comparing the Bayesian evidence between a linear and non-linear ephemeris, which is based on an N-body simulation. Nested sampling is used to derive posterior distributions for the N-body ephemeris and in order to expedite convergence custom priors are designed using machine learning. A dual input convolutional neural network is designed to predict the parameters of a perturbing body given the known parameters (M*, M1, P1) and measured perturbation (O-C). There is evidence for 3 new multi-planet systems with non-transiting companions using the 2-minute cadence observations from TESS. Two previously known exoplanets were looked at; WASP-18 b and WASP-126 b and there is evidence for WASP-18 c at a period of 2.155+/-0.006 day with a mass of 55.2+/-12.3 M\_Earth and WASP-126 c a 64.0+/-26.9 M\_Earth planet at an orbital period of 7.65+/-0.27 day. The third system with a significant TTV is TOI 193.01 with a candidate planet, TOI 193.02, at a period of 1.516+/-0.021 day and mass of 39.4+/-9.5 M\_Earth.},

  abstract = {M-stars are the most common hosts of planetary systems in the Galaxy. Protoplanetary disks around M-stars thus offer a prime opportunity to study the chemistry of planet-forming environments. We present an ALMA survey of molecular line emission toward a sample of five protoplanetary disks around M4-M5 stars (FP Tau, J0432+1827, J1100-7619, J1545-3417, and Sz 69). These observations can resolve chemical structures down to tens of AU. Molecular lines of \$\^\{12\}\$CO, \$\^\{13\}\$CO, C\$\^\{18\}\$O, C\$\_2\$H, and HCN are detected toward all five disks. Lines of H\$\_2\$CO and DCN are detected toward 2/5 and 1/5 disks, respectively. For disks with resolved C\$\^\{18\}\$O, C\$\_2\$H, HCN, and H\$\_2\$CO emission, we observe substructures similar to those previously found in disks around solar-type stars (e.g., rings, holes, and plateaus). C\$\_2\$H and HCN excitation conditions estimated interior to the pebble disk edge for the bright disk J1100-7619 are consistent with previous measurements around solar-type stars. The correlation previously found between C\$\_2\$H and HCN fluxes for solar-type disks extends to our M4-M5 disk sample, but the typical C\$\_2\$H/HCN ratio is higher for the M4-M5 disk sample. This latter finding is reminiscent of the hydrocarbon enhancements found by previous observational infrared surveys in the innermost (\$\textbackslash textless\$10AU) regions of M-star disks, which is intriguing since our disk-averaged fluxes are heavily influenced by flux levels in the outermost disk, exterior to the pebble disk edge. Overall, most of the observable chemistry at 10-100AU appears similar for solar-type and M4-M5 disks, but hydrocarbons may be more abundant around the cooler stars.},

A constraint on the dissipation parameter \$Q\_\textbackslash backslashstar'\$ follows from the assumption that tides have managed to spin up the star to the observed rate within the age of the system. This technique was applied previously to HATS-18 and WASP-19. Here we analyze the sample of all 188 known hot Jupiters with an orbital period \$\textbackslash textless 3.5\$ days and a "cool" host star (\$T\_\{eff\} \textbackslash textless 6100\$ K).

This helps to resolve a number of apparent discrepancies between studies of tidal dissipation in binary stars, hot Jupiters, and warm Jupiters. It may also allow for a hot Jupiter to damp the obliquity of its host star prior to being destroyed by tidal decay.},

  abstract = {Accounting for the effects of stellar magnetic phenomena is indispensable to fully exploit radial velocities (RVs). Correlated time variations are often mitigated by Gaussian processes (GP). They rely on fitting kernel functions that are motivated on mathematical grounds, and whose physical interpretation is often elusive. We aim to establish a connection between stellar activity affecting RVs and their correlations with physical parameters, and compare this connection with kernels used in the literature. We use simple activity models to investigate the relationship between the physical processes generating the signals and the covariances typically found in data, and to demonstrate the qualitative behaviour of this relationship. We use the StarSim code to calculate RVs of an M dwarf with different realistic evolving spot configurations. Their auto-correlation functions (ACF) show a very specific behaviour and are related to the kernel. GP regression is performed using a quasi-periodic (QP) and harmonic oscillator kernels. Comparison of the resulting kernels with the exact ACFs allows us to cross-match the kernel hyper-parameters with the introduced physical values, study the overall capabilities of the kernels, and improve their definition. We find that the QP kernel provides a more straightforward interpretation of the physics. It is able to consistently recover both the introduced rotation period P and the spot lifetime. Our study indicates that the performance can be enhanced by fixing the form factor w and adding a physically motivated cosine term with period P/2, where the contribution to the ACF for the different spot configurations differs significantly. The new quasi-periodic with cosine kernel leads to significantly better model likelihoods, can potentially distinguish between different spot configurations, and can thereby improve the sensitivity of RV exoplanet searches.},

A study using LOFAR data announced the detection of radio emission from the mid M-type dwarf GJ 1151 that could potentially arise from a close-in terrestrial planet. Recently, the presence of a 2.5-Me planet orbiting GJ 1151 with a 2-day period has been claimed using 69 radial velocities (RVs) from the HARPS-N and HPF instruments. We have obtained 70 new high-precision RV measurements in the framework of the CARMENES M-dwarf survey and use these data to confirm the presence of the claimed planet and to place limits on possible planetary companions in the GJ 1151 system. We analyse the periodicities present in the combined RV data sets from all three instruments and calculate the detection limits for potential planets in short-period orbits. We cannot confirm the recently-announced candidate planet and conclude that the 2-day signal in the HARPS-N and HPF data sets is most probably produced by a combination of the time sampling and long-term RV variability, the latter possibly arising from an outer planetary companion yet unconstrained. We calculate a 99.9\% significance detection limit of 1.50 ms-1 in the RV semi-amplitude, which places upper limits of 0.7 Me and 1.2 Me to the minimum masses of any potential exoplanets with orbital periods of 1 and 5 days, respectively.},

Models of such gaseous envelopes have been constructed subject to the assumption that the gas everywhere is on the same adiabat as that in the surrounding nebula. The gaseous envelope extends from the surface of the core to the distance at which the gravitational attraction of core plus envelope becomes equal to the gradient of the gravitational potential in the solar nebula; at this point the pressure and temperature of the gas in the envelope are required to attain the background values characteristics of the solar nebula. In general, as the mass of the condensed core increases, increasing amounts of gas became concentrated in the envelope, and these envelopes are stable against hydrodynamic instabilities. However, the core mass then goes through a maximum and starts to decrease. In most of the models tested, the envelopes were hydrodynamically unstable beyond the peak in the core mass. An unstable situation was always created if it was insisted that the core mass contain a larger amount of matter than given by these solutions. For an initial adiabat characterized by a temperature of 450\textdegree K and a pressure of 5 \texttimes{} 10-6 atm, the maximum core mass at which instability occurs is approximately 115 earth masses; this value is rather insensitive to the position in the solar nebula or to the background pressure of the solar nebula. However, if the adiabat is lowered, then the core mass corresponding to instability is decreased. Since the core masses found by Podolak and Cameron for the giant planets are significantly less than the critical core mass corresponding to the initial solar nebula adiabat, we conclude that the giant planets obtained their large amounts of hydrogen and helium by a hydrodynamic collapse process in the solar nebula only after the nebula had been subjected to a considerable period of cooling. \textcopyright{} 1974.},

We found 603 planets, including 10 that are Earth size (1-2 R) and receive comparable levels of stellar energy to that of Earth (0.25-4 F). We account for Kepler's imperfect detectability of such planets by injecting synthetic planet-caused dimmings into the Kepler brightness measurements and recording the fraction detected. We find that 11 {$\pm$} 4\% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earthsize planet receiving between one and four times the stellar intensity as Earth. We also find that the occurrence of Earth-size planets is constant with increasing orbital period (P), within equal intervals of logP up to {$\sim$}200 d. Extrapolating, one finds 5.7+1.7-2.2 \% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet with orbital periods of 200-400 d.},

  abstract = {Probing the connection between a star's metallicity and the presence and properties of any associated planets offers an observational link between conditions during the epoch of planet formation and mature planetary systems. We explore this connection by analyzing the metallicities of Kepler target stars and the subset of stars found to host transiting planets. After correcting for survey incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number of planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity \$M\$. Planet occurrence correlates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital periods. For warm super-Earths having \$P = 10-100\$ days and \$R\_P = 1.0-1.7{$\sim$}R\_E\$, planet occurrence is nearly constant over metallicities spanning \$-\$0.4 dex to +0.4 dex. We find 20 warm super-Earths per 100 stars, regardless of metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes (\$R\_P = 1.7-4.0{$\sim$}R\_E\$) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40 planets per 100 stars. We model the distribution of planets as \$d f \textbackslash backslashpropto 10\^\{\textbackslash backslashbeta M\} d M\$, where \$\textbackslash backslashbeta\$ characterizes the strength of any metallicity correlation. This correlation steepens with decreasing orbital period and increasing planet size. For warm super-Earths \$\textbackslash backslashbeta = -0.3\^\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.2\}\$, while for hot Jupiters \$\textbackslash backslashbeta = +3.4\^\{+0.9\}\_\{-0.8\}\$. High metallicities in protoplanetary disks may increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the speed at which they are assembled, enhancing the production of planets larger than 1.7 \$R\_E\$. The association between high metallicity and short-period planets may reflect disk density profiles that facilitate the inward migration of solids or higher rates of planet-planet scattering.},

  abstract = {Recently, several groups have resolved a gap that bifurcates planets between the size of Earth and Neptune into two populations. The location and depth of this feature is an important signature of the physical processes that form and sculpt planets. In particular, planets residing in the radius gap are valuable probes of these processes as they may be undergoing the final stages of envelope loss. Here, we discuss two views of the radius gap by Fulton \& Petigura (2018; F18) and Van Eylen et al. (2018; V18). In V18, the gap is wider and more devoid of planets. This is due, in part, to V18's more precise measurements of planet radius \$R\_p\$. Thanks to Gaia, uncertainties in stellar radii Rstar are no longer the limiting uncertainties in determining \$R\_p\$ for the majority of Kepler planets; instead, errors in \$R\_p/R\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$ dominate. V18's analysis incorporated short-cadence photometry along with constraints on mean stelar density that enabled more accurate determinations of \$R\_p/R\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$. In the F18 analysis, less accurate \$R\_p/R\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$ blurs the boundary the radius gap. The differences in \$R\_p/R\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$ are largest at high impact parameter (\$b \textbackslash backslashgtrsim 0.8\$) and often exceed 10\%. This motivates excluding high-\$b\$ planets from demographic studies, but identifying such planets from long-cadence photometry alone is challenging. We show that transit duration can serve as an effective proxy, and we leverage this information to enhance the contrast between the super-Earth and sub-Neptune populations.},

  abstract = {The dynamical stability of tightly packed exoplanetary systems remains poorly understood. While for a two-planet system a sharp stability boundary exists, numerical simulations of three and more planet systems show that they can experience instability on timescales up to billions of years. Moreover, an exponential trend between the planet orbital separation measured in units of Hill radii and the survival time has been reported. While these findings have been observed in numerous numerical simulations, little is known of the actual mechanism leading to instability. Contrary to a constant diffusion process, planetary systems seem to remain dynamically quiescent for most of their lifetime before a very short unstable phase. In this work, we show how the slow chaotic diffusion due to the overlap of three-body resonances dominates the timescale leading to the instability for initially coplanar and circular orbits. While the last instability phase is related to scattering due to two-planet mean motion resonances (MMR), for circular orbits the two-planets MMR are too far separated to destabilize systems initially away from them. We develop an analytical model to generalize the empirical trend obtained for equal mass and equally-spaced planets to general systems. We obtain an analytical estimate of the survival time consistent with simulations over four orders of magnitude for the planet to star mass ratio \$\textbackslash backslashepsilon\$, and 6 to 8 orders of magnitude for the instability time. We also confirm that measuring the orbital spacing in terms of Hill radii is not adapted and that the right spacing unit scales as \$\textbackslash backslashepsilon\^\{1/4\}\$. We predict that beyond a certain spacing, the three-planet resonances are not overlapped, which results in an increase of the survival time. We finally discuss the extension of our result to more general systems, containing more planets on initially non circular orbits.},

We study the possibility that the warm Jupiters are undergoing secular eccentricity oscillations excited by an outer companion (a planet or star) in an eccentric and/or mutually inclined orbit. In this model the warm Jupiters migrate periodically, in the high-eccentricity phase of the oscillation when the pericenter distance is small, but are typically observed at much lower eccentricities. We show that the steady-state eccentricity distribution of the warm Jupiters migrating by this mechanism is approximately flat, which is consistent with the observed distribution if and only if we restrict the sample to warm Jupiters that have outer companions detected by radial-velocity surveys. The eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters without companions exhibits a peak at low eccentricities (\$e\textbackslash backslashlesssim 0.2\$) that must be explained by a different formation mechanism. Based on a population-synthesis study we find that high-eccentricity migration excited by an outer planetary companion (i) can account for \$\textbackslash backslashsim20\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the warm Jupiters and most of the warm Jupiters with \$e\textbackslash backslashgtrsim 0.4\$, a fraction that is consistent with the observed population of warm Jupiters with outer companions; (ii) can produce most of the observed population of hot Jupiters, with a semimajor axis distribution that matches the observations, but fails to account adequately for \$\textbackslash backslashsim 60\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of hot Jupiters with projected obliquities \$\textbackslash backslashlesssim 20\^\textbackslash backslashcirc\$. Thus \$\textbackslash backslashsim 20\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the warm Jupiters and \$\textbackslash backslashsim 60\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of the hot Jupiters can be produced by high-eccentricity migration. We also provide predictions for the expected mutual inclinations and spin-orbit angles of the planetary systems with hot and warm Jupiters produced by high-eccentricity migration.},

They are nearly coplanar to each other; the inner one has a large eccentricity ({$\sim$}0.82); and the apses of the two orbits librate around anti-alignment. Such a state defies available proposals for large eccentricities. We argue that it is instead uniquely produced by a decaying protoplanetary disk. When the disk was massive, its precessional effect on the planets forced the two apses to center around an anti-aligned state. And as the disk is gradually eroded, the pair of planets are adiabatically transported to a new state where most of the eccentricity (or rather, the angular momentum deficit) is transferred to the inner planet, and the two apses are largely anti-aligned. During this transport, any initial mutual inclination may be reduced or enhanced; either may be compatible with the current constraints. So a primordial disk can drive up planet eccentricities both in resonant planet pairs (as has been shown for GJ 876) and in secularly interacting, non-resonant pairs. The mechanism discussed here may be relevant for forming hot Jupiters and for explaining the observed eccentricities of warm and cold giant planets.},

We analyzed K-band VLT/SINFONI medium-resolution (R\_lambda{$\sim$}5577) observations of the young giant exoplanet HIP 65426 b. Our dedicated IFS data analysis toolkit (TExTRIS) optimized the cube building, star registration, and allowed for the extraction of the planet spectrum. A Bayesian inference with the nested sampling algorithm coupled with the self-consistent forward atmospheric models BT-SETTL15 and Exo-REM using the ForMoSA tool yields Teff=1560 +/- 100K, log(g)\textbackslash textless4.40dex, [M/H]=0.05 +/- 0.22dex, and an upper limit on the C/O ratio (\textbackslash textless0.55). The object is also re-detected with the so-called "molecular mapping" technique. The technique yields consistent atmospheric parameters, but the loss of the planet pseudo-continuum in the process degrades or modifies the constraints on these parameters. The solar to sub-solar C/O ratio suggests an enrichment by solids at formation if the planet was formed beyond the water snowline (\textbackslash textgreater20 au) by core-accretion. However, a formation by gravitational instability can not be ruled out. The metallicity is compatible with the bulk enrichment of massive Jovian planets from the Bern planet population models. Finally, we measure a radial velocity of 26 +/- 15km/s compatible with our revised measurement on the star. This is the fourth imaged exoplanet for which a radial velocity can be evaluated, illustrating the potential of such observations for assessing the coevolution of imaged systems belonging to star forming regions, such as HIP 65426.},

Observational studies seem to show that the disc frequency decreases rapidly with cluster age with \textbackslash textless10\% of cluster stars retaining their discs for longer than 2-6 Myr. Given that at least half of all stars in the field seem to harbor one or more planets, this would imply extremely fast disc dispersal and rapid planet growth.

Critically, for ages \textbackslash textgreater3Myr only stars that originally populated the densest areas of very populous clusters, which are prone to disc erosion, are actually considered. This tiny sample may not be representative of the majority of stars.

Equally our solar system, with a likely formation time \textbackslash textgreater 10 Myr, need no longer be an exception but in fact typical of planetary systems.},

Originally generated during planet formation, they are scattered from their original systems and subsequently drift through interstellar space. As a consequence they should seed molecular clouds with at least hundred-metre-scale objects. We consider how the galactic background density of planetesimals, enriched from successive generations of star and system formation, can be incorporated into forming stellar systems. We find that at minimum of the order of 10\$\^\{7\}\$ `Oumuamua-sized and larger objects, plausibly including hundred-kilometre-scale objects, should be present in protoplanetary disks. At such initial sizes, the growth process of these seed planetesimals in the initial gas- and dust-rich protoplanetary disks is likely to be substantially accelerated. This could resolve the tension between accretionary timescales and the observed youth of fully-fledged planetary systems. Our results strongly advocate that the population of interstellar planetesimals should be taken into account in future studies of planet formation. As not only the Galaxy's stellar metallicity increased over time but also the density of interstellar objects, we hypothesize that this enriched seeding accelerates and enhances planetary formation after the first couple of generations of planetary systems.},

When the first planet reaches the inner edge of the disk its migration stops and the second planet is locked in resonance. We detail the resonant trapping comparing semi-analytical formulae and numerical simulations in the case of two equal-mass coplanar planets trapped in first order resonances. We describe the family of resonant stable equilibrium points (zero-amplitude libration orbits) using expanded and non-expanded Hamiltonians. We show that during convergent migration the planets evolve along these families of equilibria. Eccentricity damping from the disk leads to a final equilibrium configuration that we predict analytically. The fact that observed multi-exoplanetary systems are rarely seen in resonances suggests that the resonant configurations achieved by migration can become unstable after the removal of the disk. We probe the stability of the resonances as a function of planetary mass. To do this, we fictitiously increase the masses of the planets, adiabatically maintaining the low-amplitude libration regime until instability. We discuss two hypotheses for instability: low-order secondary resonance of the libration frequency with a fast synodic frequency, and minimal approach distance between planets. We show that secondary resonances do not seem to impact resonant systems at low-amplitude of libration. Resonant systems are more stable than non-resonant ones for a given minimal distance at close encounters, but we show that the latter still play the decisive role in the destabilisation of resonant pairs. We show that, as the planetary mass increases and the minimal distance between planets gets smaller in terms of mutual Hill radius, the region of stability around the resonance center shrinks, until the equilibrium point itself becomes unstable.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that most chains of mean motion resonances of type \$k\$:\$k-1\$ among exoplanets become unstable once the dissipative action from the gas is removed from the system, particularly for large \$N\$ (the number of planets) and \$k\$ (indicating how compact the chain is). We present a novel dynamical mechanism that can explain the origin of these instabilities and thus the dearth of resonant systems in the exoplanet sample. It relies on the emergence of secondary resonances between a fraction of the synodic frequency \$2 \textbackslash backslashpi (1/P\_1-1/P\_2)\$ and the libration frequencies in the mean motion resonance. These secondary resonances excite the amplitudes of libration of the mean motion resonances thus leading to an instability. We detail the emergence of these secondary resonances by carrying out an explicit perturbative scheme to second order in the planetary masses and isolating the harmonic terms that are associated with them. Focusing on the case of three planets in the 3:2 \textendash{} 3:2 mean motion resonance as an example, a simple but general analytical model of one of these resonances is obtained which describes the initial phase of the activation of one such secondary resonance. The dynamics of the excited system is also briefly described. This scheme shows how one can obtain analytical insight into the emergence of these resonances, and into the dynamics that they trigger. Finally, a generalisation of this dynamical mechanism is obtained for arbitrary \$N\$ and \$k\$. This leads to an explanation of previous numerical experiments on the stability of resonant chains, showing why the critical planetary mass allowed for stability decreases with increasing \$N\$ and \$k\$.},

We present here a new generation of X-ray photoevaporation models for solar-type stars, based on a new set of hydrodynamical simulations, which account for stellar irradiation via a new, significantly improved, parameterisation of gas temperatures, based on detailed photoionisation and radiation transfer calculations. This is the first of a series of papers aiming at providing a library of models which cover the observed parameter space in stellar and disc mass, metallicity and stellar X-ray properties. We focus here on solar-type stars (0.7 M\$\_\textbackslash backslashodot\$) with relatively low-mass discs (1\% of the stellar mass) and explore the dependence of the wind mass loss rates on stellar X-ray luminosity. We model primordial discs as well as transition discs at various stages of evolution. Our 2D hydrodynamical models are then used to derive simple recipes for the mass loss rates that are suitable for inclusion in one-dimensional disc evolution and/or planet formation models typically employed for population synthesis studies. Line profiles from typical wind diagnostics ([OI] 6300 \$\textbackslash backslashoverset\{\textbackslash backslashlower.5em\textbackslash backslashcirc\}\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{A\}\}\$ and [NeII] 12.8 \$\textbackslash backslashmu\$m) are also calculated for our models and found to be roughly in agreement with previous studies. Finally, we perform a population study of transition discs by means of one-dimensional viscous evolution models including our new photoevaporation prescription and find that roughly a half of observed transition discs cavities and accretion rates could be reproduced by our models.},

We apply the algorithms to a suite of numerical simulations of (single and multiple) low-amplitude Keplerian RV signals induced by low-mass companions around M-dwarf primaries. The global performance of the three period search approaches is quite similar in the limit of an idealized, best-case scenario (single planets, circular orbits, white noise). However, GLS, BGLS and FREDEC are not equivalent when it comes to the correct identification of more complex signals (including correlated noise of stellar origin, eccentric orbits, multiple planets), with variable degrees of efficiency loss as a function of system parameters and degradation in completeness and reliability levels. The largest discrepancy is recorded in the number of false detections: The standard approach of residual analyses adopted for GLS and BGLS translates in large fractions of false alarms ({$\sim$}30 per cent) in the case of multiple systems, as opposed to {$\sim$}10 per cent for the FREDEC approach of simultaneous multifrequency search. Our results reinforce the need for the strengthening and further development of the most aggressive and effective ab initio strategies for the robust identification of low-amplitude planetary signals in RV data sets, particularly now that RV surveys are beginning to achieve sensitivity to potentially habitable Earth-mass planets around late-type stars.},

  abstract = {Context. Small rocky planets seem to be very abundant around low-mass M-type stars. Their actual planetary population is however not yet precisely understood. Currently, several surveys aim to expand the statistics with intensive detection campaigns, both photometric and spectroscopic. Aims. The HADES program aims to improve the current statistics through the in-depth analysis of accurate radial-velocity (RV) monitoring in a narrow range of spectral sub-types, with the precision needed to detect small planets with a few Earth masses. Methods. We analyse 106 spectroscopic HARPS-N observations of the active M0-type star GJ 685 taken over the past five years. We combine these data with photometric measurements from different observatories to accurately model the stellar rotation and disentangle its signals from genuine Doppler planetary signals in the RV data. We run an MCMC analysis on the RV and activity index time series to model the planetary and stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian Process regression technique to deal with the stellar activity signals. Results. We identify three periodic signals in the RV time series, with periods of 9, 24, and 18 d. Combining the analyses of the photometry of the star with the activity indexes derived from the HARPS-N spectra, we identify the 18 d and 9 d signals as activity-related, corresponding to the stellar rotation period and its first harmonic, respectively. The 24 d signal shows no relation to any activity proxy, and therefore we identify it as a genuine planetary signal. We find the best-fit model describing the Doppler signal of the newly found planet, GJ 685 b, corresponding to an orbital period Pb = 24.160-0.047+0.061 d and a minimum mass MP sin i = 9.0-1.8+1.7 M{$\odot$}. We also study a sample of 70 RV-detected M-dwarf planets, and present new statistical evidence of a difference in mass distribution between the populations of single- and multi-planet systems, which can shed new light on the formation mechanisms of low-mass planets around late-type stars.},

  abstract = {[abridged] Recent laboratory experiments indicate that destructive collisions of icy dust particles occur with much lower velocities than previously thought. When considering these new velocities from laboratory experiments in dust evolution models, growing to pebble sizes in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is difficult, which may contradict (sub-) millimeter observations and challenge the formation of planetesimals and planets. We investigate what conditions are required in dust evolution models to grow and trap pebbles in PPDs when the fragmentation speed is 1 ms\$\^\{-1\}\$. We disentangle the parameters controlling the effects of turbulent velocities, vertical stirring, radial diffusion, and gas viscous evolution, always assuming that particles cannot diffuse faster (radially or vertically) than the gas. To form pebbles and have effective particle trapping, the parameter that controls the particle turbulent velocities must be low (\$\textbackslash backslashlesssim10\^\{-4\}\$). In these cases, the vertical settling can limit the formation of pebbles, which also prevents particle trapping. Therefore, the parameter that sets the vertical settling and stirring of the grains must be \$\textbackslash textless10\^\{-3\}\$. Our results suggest that different combinations of the particle and gas diffusion parameters can lead to a large diversity of millimeter fluxes and dust disk radii. When pebble formation happens and trapping is efficient, gaps and rings have higher contrast at millimeter emission than at near-infrared. In the case of inefficient trapping, structures are also formed at the two wavelengths, producing deeper and wider gaps in the near-infrared. Our results highlight the importance to obtain observational constrains of gas and particle diffusion parameters and the properties of gaps at short and long wavelengths to better understand basic features of PPDs and the origin of the seen structures in these objects.},

  abstract = {[abridged] Demographic surveys of protoplanetary disks, mainly with ALMA, have provided access to a large range of disk dust masses (\$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm\{dust\}\}\$) around stars with different stellar types and for different star-forming regions. These surveys found a linear relation in logarithmic scale between \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm\{dust\}\}\$ and \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashstar\}\$ that steepens with time, but that is flatter for transition disks (TDs). We perform dust evolution models and include perturbations to the gas surface density with different amplitudes to investigate the effect of particle trapping on the \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm\{dust\}\}-M\_\{\textbackslash backslashstar\}\$ relation. These perturbations aim to mimic pressure bumps originated by planets. We focus on the effect caused by different stellar and disk masses because exoplanet statistics show a dependence of planet mass with stellar mass and metallicity. We find that models of dust evolution can reproduced the observed \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm\{dust\}\}-M\_\{\textbackslash backslashstar\}\$ relation in different star-forming regions when strong pressure bumps are included and when the disk mass scales with stellar mass (case of \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm\{disk\}\}=0.05\textbackslash backslash,M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$ in our models). This result arises from dust trapping and dust growth beyond centimeter-size grains inside pressure bumps. However, the flatter relation of \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm\{dust\}\}-M\_\{\textbackslash backslashstar\}\$ for TDs and disks with substructures cannot be reproduced by the models, unless the formation of boulders is inhibited inside pressure bumps. In the context of planets originating pressure bumps, our results agree with the current exoplanet statistics about giant planet occurrence increasing with stellar mass, but we cannot conclude about the type of planets needed in the case of low mass stars. This is because for \$M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\textbackslash textless1\textbackslash backslash,M\_\textbackslash backslashodot\$, the observed \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm\{dust\}\}\$ obtained from models is very low due to the efficient growth of dust particles beyond centimeter sizes (boulders) inside pressure bumps.},

The disk around CIDA 1 (\textasciitilde 0.1\textendash 0.2 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) is one of the very few known disks that host a large cavity (20 au radius in size) around a very low-mass star.

These new ALMA observations reveal a very bright and unresolved inner disk, a shallow spectral index of the dust emission (\textasciitilde 2), and a complex morphology of a ring located at 20 au.

Even in this planet mass regime, an additional physical process may be needed to stop the particles from migrating inwards and to maintain a bright inner disk on timescales of millions of years. Such mechanisms include a trap formed by a very close-in extra planet or the inner edge of a dead zone. The low spectral index of the disk around CIDA 1 is difficult to explain and challenges our current dust evolution models, in particular processes like fragmentation, growth, and diffusion of particles inside pressure bumps.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Most of the kinks are detected over a small range in both radial extent and velocity, suggesting a planetary origin, but for some of them foreground contamination prevents us from measuring their spatial and velocity extent. Because of the DSHARP limited spectral resolution and signal-to-noise in the 12CO J=2-1 line, as well as cloud contamination, the kinks are usually detected in only one spectral channel, and will require confirmation. The strongest circumstantial evidence for protoplanets in the absence of higher spectral resolution data and additional tracers is that, upon deprojection, we find that all of the candidate planets lie within a gap and/or at the end of a spiral detected in dust continuum emission. This suggests that a significant fraction of the dust gaps and spirals observed by ALMA in disks are caused by embedded protoplanets.},

  abstract = {In the core accretion hypothesis, giant planets form by gas accretion onto solid protoplanetary cores. The minimum (or critical) core mass to form a gas giant is typically quoted as 10 M {$\oplus$}. The actual value depends on several factors: the location in the protoplanetary disk, atmospheric opacity, and the accretion rate of solids. Motivated by ongoing direct imaging searches for giant planets, this study investigates core mass requirements in the outer disk. To determine the fastest allowed rates of gas accretion, we consider solid cores that no longer accrete planetesimals, as this would heat the gaseous envelope. Our spherical, two-layer atmospheric cooling model includes an inner convective region and an outer radiative zone that matches onto the disk. We determine the minimum core mass for a giant planet to form within a typical disk lifetime of 3 Myr. The minimum core mass declines with disk radius, from {$\sim$}8.5 M {$\oplus$} at 5 AU to {$\sim$}3.5 M {$\oplus$} at 100 AU, with standard interstellar grain opacities. Lower temperatures in the outer disk explain this trend, while variations in disk density are less influential. At all distances, a lower dust opacity or higher mean molecular weight reduces the critical core mass. Our non-self-gravitating, analytic cooling model reveals that self-gravity significantly affects early atmospheric evolution, starting when the atmosphere is only {$\sim$}10\% as massive as the core. \textcopyright{} 2014.

  abstract = {Most planets currently amenable to transit spectroscopy are close enough to their host star to exhibit a relatively strong day to night temperature gradient. For hot planets, this leads to cause a chemical composition dichotomy between the two hemispheres. In the extreme case of ultra hot jupiters, some species, such as molecular hydrogen and water, are strongly dissociated on the day-side while others, such as carbon monoxide, are not. However, most current retrieval algorithm rely on 1D forward models that are unable to model this effect. We thus investigate how the 3D structure of the atmosphere biases the abundances retrieved using commonly used algorithms. We study the case of Wasp-121b as a prototypical ultra hot Jupiter. We use the simulations of this planet performed with the SPARC/MIT global climate model (GCM) and generate transmission spectra that fully account for the 3D structure of the atmosphere with Pytmopsh3R. These spectra are then analyzed using the \$\textbackslash backslash\$taurex retrieval code. We find that such ultra hot jupiter's transmission spectra exhibit muted H\$\_2\$O features that originate in the night-side where the temperature, hence the scale-height, is smaller than on the day-side. However, the spectral features of molecules present on the day-side are boosted by both its high temperature and low mean molecular weight. As a result, the retrieved parameters are strongly biased compared to the ground truth. In particular the [CO]/[H\$\_2\$O] is overestimated by one to three orders of magnitude. This must be kept in mind when using such retrieval analysis to infer the C/O ratio of a planet's atmosphere. We also discuss whether indicators can allow us to infer the 3D structure of an observed atmosphere. Finally we show that HST/WFC3 transmission data of Wasp-121b are compatible with the day-night thermal and compositional dichotomy predicted by models.},

Using a newly developed code, we accurately combine a detailed three-body trajectory calculation with gas drag experienced during the passage of planetesimals in the protoplanet's envelope. We find that the motion of planetesimals is excited to the extent that encounters with the proto-planetary envelope become so fast that ram pressure breaks up the planetesimals in most encounters. As a result, the accretion rate is largely independent of the planetesimal size and composition. For the case we explored of a planet forming at 5.2 AU from the Sun in a disk with a solid surface density of 6 g cm-2 (Lozovsky et al. 2017) the accretion rate we compute differs in several respects from that assumed by those authors. We find that only 4 - 5 M is accreted in the first 1.5 \texttimes{} 106 years before the onset of rapid gas accretion. Most of the mass, some 10 M, is accreted simultaneously with this rapid gas accretion. In addition, we find that the mass accretion rate remains small, but non-zero for at least a million years after this point, and an additional 0.3 - 0.4 M is accreted during that time. This late accretion, together with a rapid infall of gas could lead to the accreted material being mixed throughout the outer regions, and may account for the enhancement of high-Z material in Jupiter's envelope.},

We observe polarized scattered light down to 0.16" ({$\sim$}19 au) and find an inner gap with a significantly reduced scattered light flux. We confirm the previously detected double ring structure peaking at 0.18" ({$\sim$}21 au) and 0.56" ({$\sim$}66 au), and marginally detect a faint third gap at 0.70"-0.73" ({$\sim$}82-85 au). We explore dust evolution models in a disk perturbed by two giant planets, as well as models with a parameterized dust size distribution. The dust evolution model is able to reproduce the ring locations and gap widths in polarized intensity, but fails to reproduce their depths. It, however, gives a good match with the ALMA dust continuum image at 1.3 mm. Models with a parameterized dust size distribution better reproduce the gap depth in scattered light, suggesting that dust filtration at the outer edges of the gaps is less effective. The pile-up of millimeter grains in a dust trap and the continuous distribution of small grains throughout the gap likely require a more efficient dust fragmentation and dust diffusion in the dust trap. Alternatively, turbulence or charging effects might lead to a reservoir of small grains at the surface layer that is not affected by the dust growth and fragmentation cycle dominating the dense disk midplane. The exploration of models shows that extracting planet properties such as mass from observed gap profiles is highly degenerate.},

  abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Z masses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density ({$\sigma$}init) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that {$\sigma$}init{$\approx$} 10 g cm-2near Jupiter's orbit and that {$\sigma$}init{$\propto$} a-2, where a is the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the "minimum-mass" solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems. \textcopyright{} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {The two dominant features in the distribution of orbital parameters for close-in exoplanets are the prevalence of circular orbits for very short periods, and the observation that planets on closer orbits tend to be heavier. The first feature is interpreted as a signature of tidal evolution, while the origin of the second, a 'mass-period relation' for hot Jupiters, is not understood. In this paper we reconsider the ensemble properties of transiting exoplanets with well-measured parameters, focusing on orbital eccentricity and the mass-period relation. We recalculate the constraints on eccentricity in a homogeneous way, using new radial velocity data, with particular attention to statistical biases. We find that planets on circular orbits gather in a well-defined region of the mass-period plane, close to the minimum period for any given mass. Exceptions to this pattern reported in the literature can be attributed to statistical biases. The ensemble data is compatible with classical tide theory with orbital circularization caused by tides raised on the planet, and suggest that tidal circularization and the stopping mechanisms for close-in planets are closely related to each other. The position mass-period relation is compatible with a relation between a planet's Hill radius and its present orbit. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \textcopyright{} 2011 RAS.},

  abstract = {Approximately half of the planets discovered by NASA's Kepler mission are in systems where just a single planet transits its host star, and the remaining planets are observed to be in multi-planet systems. Recent analyses have reported a dichotomy in the eccentricity distribution displayed by systems where a single planet transits compared with that displayed by the multi-planet systems. Using \$N\$-body simulations, we examine the hypothesis that this dichotomy has arisen because inner systems of super-Earths are frequently accompanied by outer systems of giant planets that can become dynamically unstable and perturb the inner systems. Our initial conditions are constructed using a subset of the known Kepler five-planet systems as templates for the inner systems, and systems of outer giant planets with masses between those of Neptune and Saturn that are centred on orbital radii \$2 \textbackslash backslashle a\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm p\} \textbackslash backslashle 10\$ au. The parameters of the outer systems are chosen so that they are always below an assumed radial velocity detection threshold of 3 ms\$\^\{-1\}\$. The results show an inverse relation between the mean eccentricities and the multiplicites of the systems. Performing synthetic transit observation of the final systems reveals dichotomies in both the eccentricity and multiplicity distributions that are close to being in agreement with the Kepler data. Hence, understanding the observed orbital and physical properties of the compact systems of super-Earths discovered by Kepler may require holistic modelling that couples the dynamics of both inner and outer systems of planets during and after the epoch of formation.},

  abstract = {Observations have confirmed the existence of multiple-planet systems containing a hot Jupiter and smaller planetary companions. Examples include WASP-47, Kepler-730, and TOI-1130. We examine the plausibility of forming such systems in situ using N-body simulations that include a realistic treatment of collisions, an evolving protoplanetary disc and eccentricity/inclination damping of planetary embryos. Initial conditions are constructed using two different models for the core of the giant planet: a `seed-model' and an `equal-mass-model'. The former has a more massive protoplanet placed among multiple small embryos in a compact configuration. The latter consists only of equal-mass embryos. Simulations of the seed-model lead to the formation of systems containing a hot Jupiter and super-Earths. The evolution consistently follows four distinct phases: early giant impacts; runaway gas accretion onto the seed protoplanet; disc damping-dominated evolution of the embryos orbiting exterior to the giant; a late chaotic phase after dispersal of the gas disc. Approximately 1\% of the equal-mass simulations form a giant and follow the same four-phase evolution. Synthetic transit observations of the equal-mass simulations provide an occurrence rate of 0.26\% for systems containing a hot Jupiter and an inner super-Earth, similar to the 0.2\% occurrence rate from actual transit surveys, but simulated hot Jupiters are rarely detected as single transiting planets, in disagreement with observations. A subset of our simulations form two close-in giants, similar to the WASP-148 system. The scenario explored here provides a viable pathway for forming systems with unusual architectures, but does not apply to the majority of hot Jupiters.},

We study the dynamical evolution of such inner systems subject to the gravitational effect of an unstable system of outer giant planets, focussing on systems whose end configurations feature only a single remaining outer giant. In contrast to similar studies which used on N-body simulations with specific (and limited) parameters or scenarios, we implement a novel hybrid algorithm which combines N-body simulations with secular dynamics with aims of obtaining analytical understanding and scaling relations. We find that the dynamical evolution of the inner planet system depends crucially on \$N\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{ej\}\}\$, the number of mutual close encounters between the outer planets prior to eventual ejection/merger. When \$N\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{ej\}\}\$ is small, the eventual evolution of the inner planets can be well described by secular dynamics. For larger values of \$N\_\{\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{ej\}\}\$, the inner planets gain orbital inclination, inclination and eccentricity in a stochastic fashion analogous to Brownian motion. We develop a theoretical model, and compute scaling laws for the final orbital parameters of the inner system. We show that our model can account for the observed eccentric super-Earths/mini-Neptunes with inclined cold Jupiter companions, such as HAT-P-11, Gliese 777 and \$\textbackslash backslashpi\$ Men.},

With three outer planets locked in a chaotic Laplace-type resonance and an appreciably eccentric short-period Super-Earth, this system represents a unique exposition of extrasolar planetary dynamics. A key question that concerns the long-term evolution of this system, and the fate of close-in planets in general, is how the significant eccentricity of the inner-most planet is maintained against tidal circularization on timescales comparable to the age of the universe. Here, we employ stochastic secular perturbation theory and N-body simulations to show that the orbit of the inner-most planet is shaped by a delicate balance between extrinsic chaotic forcing and tidal dissipation. As such, the planet's orbital eccentricity represents an indirect measure of its tidal quality factor. Based on the system's present-day architecture, we estimate that the extrasolar Super-Earth GJ 876d has a tidal Q{$\sim$}10,000-100,000 - a value characteristic of solar system gas giants.},

Here, we report the presence of another gap at a smaller size (around one Earth radius). By focussing on planets orbiting around GK-dwarfs inward of 16 days, and correcting for observational completeness, we find that the number of super-Earths maximize around 1.4 Earth radii and disappear shortly below this size. Instead, a new population of planets (sub-Earths) appear to dominate at sizes below {$\sim$} 1 Earth radius. This pattern is also observed in ultra-short-period planets. The end of super-Earths supports earlier claims that super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, planets that likely form in gaseous proto-planetary disks, have a narrow mass distribution. The sub-Earths, in contrast, can be described by a power-law mass distribution and may be explained by the theory of terrestrial planet formation. We therefore speculate that they are formed well after the gaseous disks have dissipated. The extension of these sub-Earths towards longer orbital periods, currently invisible, may be the true terrestrial analogues. This strongly motivates new searches.},

  abstract = {The G0V star HD 166435 has been observed by the fiber-fed spectrograph ELODIE as one of the targets in the large extra-solar planet survey that we are conducting at the Observatory of Haute-Provence. We detected coherent, low-amplitude, radial-velocity variations with a period of 3.7987 days, suggesting a possible close-in planetary companion. Subsequently, we initiated a series of high-precision photometric observations to search for possible planetary transits and an additional series of Ca II H and K observations to measure the level of surface magnetic activity and to look for possible rotational modulation. Surprisingly, we found the star to be photometrically variable and magnetically active. A detailed study of the phase stability of the radial-velocity signal revealed that the radial-velocity variability remains coherent only for durations of about 30 days. Analysis of the time variation of the spectroscopic line profiles using line bisectors revealed a correlation between radial velocity and line-bisector orientation. All of these observations, along with a one-quarter cycle phase shift between the photometric and the radial-velocity variations, are well explained by the presence of dark photospheric spots on HD 166435. We conclude that the radial-velocity variations are not due to gravitational interaction with an orbiting planet but, instead, originate from line-profile changes stemming from star spots on the surface of the star. The quasi-coherence of the radial-velocity signal over more than two years, which allowed a fair fit with a binary model, makes the stability of this star unusual among other active stars. It suggests a stable magnetic field orientation where spots are always generated at about the same location on the surface of the star.},

  abstract = {Recent ALMA molecular line observations have revealed 3-D gas velocity structure in protoplanetary disks, shedding light on mechanisms of disk accretion and structure formation. 1) By carrying out viscous simulations, we confirm that the disk's velocity structure differs dramatically using vertical stress profiles from different accretion mechanisms. Thus, kinematic observations tracing flows at different disk heights can potentially distinguish different accretion mechanisms. On the other hand, the disk surface density evolution is mostly determined by the vertically integrated stress. The sharp disk outer edge constrained by recent kinematic observations can be caused by a radially varying \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ in the disk. 2) We also study kinematic signatures of a young planet by carrying out 3-D planet-disk simulations. The relationship between the planet mass and the "kink" velocity is derived, showing a linear relationship with little dependence on disk viscosity, but some dependence on disk height when the planet is massive, e.g. \$10 M\_J\$. We predict the "kink" velocities for the potential planets in DSHARP disks. At the gap edge, the azimuthally-averaged velocities at different disk heights deviate from the Keplerian velocity at similar amplitudes, and its relationship with the planet mass is consistent with that in 2-D simulations. After removing the planet, the azimuthally-averaged velocity barely changes within the viscous timescale, and thus the azimuthally-averaged velocity structure at the gap edge is due to the gap itself and not directly caused to the planet. Combining both axisymmetric kinematic observations and the residual "kink" velocity is needed to probe young planets in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {We explore the dynamics of small planetesimals coexisting with massive protoplanetary cores in a gaseous nebula. Gas drag strongly affects the motion of small bodies, leading to the decay of their eccentricities and inclinations, which are excited by the gravity of protoplanetary cores. Drag acting on larger (\textbackslash textgreater{$\sim$}1 km), high-velocity planetesimals causes a mere reduction of their average random velocity. By contrast, drag qualitatively changes the dynamics of smaller (\textbackslash textless{$\sim$}0.1-1 km), low-velocity objects: (1) small planetesimals sediment toward the midplane of the nebula, forming a vertically thin subdisk; (2) their random velocities rapidly decay between successive passages of the cores, and as a result, encounters with cores typically occur at the minimum relative velocity allowed by the shear in the disk. This leads to a drastic increase in the accretion rate of small planetesimals by the protoplanetary cores, allowing cores to grow faster than expected in the simple oligarchic picture, provided that the population of small planetesimals contains more than roughly 1\% of the solid mass in the nebula. Fragmentation of larger planetesimals (\textbackslash textgreater{$\sim$}1 km) in energetic collisions triggered by the gravitational scattering by cores can easily channel this amount of material into small bodies on reasonable timescales (\textbackslash textless1 Myr in the outer solar system), providing a means for the rapid growth (within several million years at 30 AU) of rather massive protoplanetary cores. Effects of inelastic collisions between planetesimals and presence of multiple protoplanetary cores are discussed.},

  abstract = {The habitable zone (HZ) is the circumstellar region where standing bodies of liquid water could exist on the surface of a rocky planet. Conventional definitions assume that CO2 and H2O are the only greenhouse gases. The outer edge of this classical N2-CO2-H2O HZ extends out to nearly -1.7 AU in our solar system, beyond which condensation and scattering by CO2 outstrip its greenhouse capacity. We use a single column radiative-convective climate model to assess the greenhouse effect of CH4 (10 - -100,000 ppm) on the classical HZ (N2-CO2-H2O) for main-sequence stars with stellar temperatures between 2,600 - 10,000 K (-A3 to M8). Assuming N2-CO2-H2O atmospheres, previous studies have shown that cooler stars more effectively heat terrestrial planets. However, we find that the addition of CH4 produces net greenhouse warming (tens of degrees) in planets orbiting stars hotter than a mid-K (- 4500K), whereas a prominent anti-greenhouse effect is noted for planets around cooler stars. We show that 10\% CH4 can increase the outer edge distance of the hottest stars (TEFF =10,000 K) by over 20\%. In contrast, the CH4 anti-greenhouse can shrink the HZ for the coolest stars (TEFF = 2,600 K) by a similar percentage. We find that dense CO2-CH4 atmospheres near the outer edge of hotter stars may suggest inhabitance, highlighting the importance of including secondary greenhouse gases in alternative definitions of the HZ.},

  abstract = {Finding potential life harboring exo-Earths is one of the aims of exoplanetary science. Detecting signatures of life in exoplanets will likely first be accomplished by determining the bulk composition of the planetary atmosphere via reflected/transmitted spectroscopy. However, a complete understanding of the habitability conditions will surely require mapping the presence of liquid water, continents and/or clouds. Spin-orbit tomography is a technique that allows us to obtain maps of the surface of exoplanets around other stars using the light scattered by the planetary surface. We leverage the potential of deep learning and propose a mapping technique for exo-Earths in which the regularization is learned from mock surfaces. The solution of the inverse mapping problem is posed as a deep neural network that can be trained end-to-end with suitable training data. We propose in this work to use methods based on the procedural generation of planets, inspired by what we found on Earth. We also consider mapping the recovery of surfaces and the presence of persistent cloud in cloudy planets. We show that the a reliable mapping can be carried out with our approach, producing very compact continents, even when using single passband observations. More importantly, if exoplanets are partially cloudy like the Earth is, we show that one can potentially map the distribution of persistent clouds that always occur on the same position on the surface (associated to orography and sea surface temperatures) together with non-persistent clouds that move across the surface. This will become the first test one can perform on an exoplanet for the detection of an active climate system. For small rocky planets in the habitable zone of their stars, this weather system will be driven by water, and the detection can be considered as a strong proxy for truly habitable conditions.},

Nigraha uses a combination of transit finding, supervised machine learning, and detailed vetting to identify with high confidence a few planet candidates that were missed by prior searches.

In the spirit of open data exploration we provide details of our pipeline, release our supervised machine learning model and code as open source, and make public the 38 candidates we have found in seven sectors.

In a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynamical instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this instability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccentric orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastron distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipation. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.},

  abstract = {Smaller terrestrial planets ({$\lessequivlnt$}0.3{$\oplus$}) are less likely to retain the substantial atmospheres and ongoing tectonic activity probably required to support life. A key element in determining whether sufficiently massive sustainably habitable planets can form is the availability of solid planet-forming material. We use dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation from planetary embryos and simple scaling arguments to explore the implications of correlations between terrestrial planet mass, disk mass, and the mass of the parent star. We assume that the protoplanetary disk mass scales with stellar mass as Mdisk{$\alpha$}fM*h, where f measures the relative disk mass and 1/2 \textbackslash textless h \textbackslash textless 2, so that disk mass decreases with decreasing stellar mass. We consider systems without Jovian planets, based on current models and observations for M stars. We assume the mass of a planet formed in some annulus of a disk with given parameters is proportional to the disk mass in that annulus and show with a suite of simulations of late-stage accretion that the adopted prescription is surprisingly accurate. Our results suggest that the fraction of systems with sufficient disk mass to form \textbackslash textgreater0.3 M{$\oplus$}habitable planets decreases for low-mass stars for every realistic combination of parameters. This habitable fraction is small for stellar masses below a mass in the interval 0.5-0.8 M{$\oplus$}, depending on disk parameters, an interval that excludes most M stars. Radial mixing and therefore water delivery are inefficient in the lower mass disks commonly found around low-mass stars, such that terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of most low-mass stars are likely to be small and dry. \textcopyright{} 2007.

Using N-body simulations we investigate the dynamics of marginally unstable systems of gas and ice giants both in isolation and when the planets form interior to a planetesimal belt. The unstable isolated systems evolve under planet-planet scattering to yield an eccentricity distribution that matches that observed for extrasolar planets. When planetesimals are included the outcome depends upon the total mass of the planets. For M tot {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 MJ the final eccentricity distribution remains broad, whereas for M tot {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 MJ a combination of divergent orbital evolution and recircularization of scattered planets results in a preponderance of nearly circular final orbits. We also study the fate of marginally stable multiple planet systems in the presence of planetesimal disks, and find that for high planet masses the majority of such systems evolve into resonance. A significant fraction leads to resonant chains that are planetary analogs of Jupiter's Galilean satellites. We predict that a transition from eccentric to near-circular orbits will be observed once extrasolar planet surveys detect sub-Jovian mass planets at orbital radii of a {$\simeq$} 5-10 AU. \textcopyright{} 2009.

  abstract = {It has been proposed that the observed systems of hot super-Earths formed in situ from highmass discs. By fitting a disc profile to the entire population of Kepler planet candidates, Chiang \& Laughlin constructed a 'minimum-mass extrasolar nebula' with surface density profile {$\sum$} {$\propto$} r-1.6. Here, we use multiple-planet systems to show that it is inconsistent to assume a universal disc profile. Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet candidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass discs with surface density profiles ranging from {$\sum$} {$\propto$} r-3.2 to {$\sum$} {$\propto$} r0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By simulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems designed to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that a universal disc profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. Rather, the underlying distribution of minimum-mass discs is characterized by a broad range of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous discs can only explain a narrow range of slopes (roughly between r0 and r-1.5). Yet accretion of terrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radial distribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths must therefore not represent the structure of their parent gas discs and cannot have predominantly formed in situ. We instead interpret the diversity of disc slopes as the imprint of a process that re-arranged the solids relative to the gas in the inner parts of protoplanetary discs. A plausible mechanism is inward type 1 migration of Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryos, perhaps followed by a final assembly phase. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

Here we show that the inner Solar System's water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets' formation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met for a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases, the orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally scattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a fraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior to Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with C-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5-20 AU-wide) region of the disk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach sufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and deliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on the giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant planet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich bodies.},

If our Solar System were observed with present-day Earth technology \textendash{} to put our system and exoplanets on the same footing \textendash{} Jupiter is the only planet that would be detectable. The statistics of exo-Jupiters indicate that the Solar System is unusual at the {$\sim$}1\% level among Sun-like stars (or {$\sim$}0.1\% among all stars). But why are we different? Successful formation models for both the Solar System and exoplanet systems rely on two key processes: orbital migration and dynamical instability. Systems of close-in super-Earths or sub-Neptunes require substantial radial inward motion of solids either as drifting mm- to cm-sized pebbles or migrating Earth-mass or larger planetary embryos. We argue that, regardless of their formation mode, the late evolution of super-Earth systems involves migration into chains of mean motion resonances, generally followed by instability when the disk dissipates. This pattern is likely also ubiquitous in giant planet systems. We present three models for inner Solar System formation \textendash{} the low-mass asteroid belt, Grand Tack, and Early Instability models \textendash{} each invoking a combination of migration and instability. We identify bifurcation points in planetary system formation. We present a series of events to explain why our Solar System is so weird. Jupiter's core must have formed fast enough to quench the growth of Earth's building blocks by blocking the flux of inward-drifting pebbles. The large Jupiter/Saturn mass ratio is rare among giant exoplanets but may be required to maintain Jupiter's wide orbit. The giant planets' instability must have been gentle, with no close encounters between Jupiter and Saturn, also unusual in the larger (exoplanet) context. Our Solar System system is thus the outcome of multiple unusual, but not unheard of, events.},

  abstract = {The asteroid belt was dynamically shaped during and after planet formation. Despite representing a broad ring of stable orbits, the belt contains less than one one-thousandth of an Earth mass. The asteroid orbits are dynamically excited with a wide range in eccentricity and inclination and their compositions are diverse, with a general trend toward dry objects in the inner belt and more water-rich objects in the outer belt. Here we review models of the asteroid belt's origins and dynamical history. The classical view is that the belt was born with several Earth masses in planetesimals, then strongly depleted. However, it is possible that very few planetesimals ever formed in the asteroid region and that the belt's story is one of implantation rather than depletion. A number of processes may have implanted asteroids from different regions of the Solar System, dynamically removed them, and excited their orbits. During the gaseous disk phase these include the effects of giant planet growth and migration and sweeping secular resonances. After the gaseous disk phase these include scattering from resident planetary embryos, chaos in the giant planets' orbits, the giant planet instability, and long-term dynamical evolution. Different global models for Solar System formation imply contrasting dynamical histories of the asteroid belt.

  abstract = {Context. The recently completed re-reduction of the Hipparcos data by van Leeuwen (2007a, Astrophysics and Space Science Library, 350) makes it possible to search for the astrometric signatures of planets and brown dwarfs known from radial velocity surveys in the improved Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data. Aims. Our aim is to put more significant constraints on the orbital parameters which cannot be derived from radial velocities alone, i.e. the inclination and the longitude of the ascending node, than was possible before. The determination of the inclination in particular allows to calculate an unambiguous companion mass, rather than the lower mass limit which can be obtained from radial velocity measurements. Methods. We fitted the astrometric orbits of 310 substellar companions around 258 stars, which were all discovered via the radial velocity method, to the Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data provided by van Leeuwen. Results. Even though the astrometric signatures of the companions cannot be detected in most cases, the Hipparcos data still provide lower limits on the inclination for all but 67 of the investigated companions, which translates into upper limits on the masses of the unseen companions. For nine companions the derived upper mass limit lies in the planetary and for 75 companions in the brown dwarf mass regime, proving the substellar nature of those objects. Two of those objects have minimum masses also in the brown dwarf regime and are thus proven to be brown dwarfs. The confirmed planets are the ones around Pollux ({$\beta$} Gem b), \"I{$\mu$} Eri b, \"I{$\mu$} Ret b, {$\mu$} Ara b, {$\upsilon$} And c and d, 47 UMa b, HD 10647 b and HD 147513 b. The confirmed brown dwarfs are HD 137510 b and HD 168443 c. In 20 cases, the astrometric signature of the substellar companion was detected in the Hipparcos data, resulting in reasonable constraints on inclination and ascending node. Of these 20 companions, three are confirmed as planets or lightweight brown dwarfs (HD 87833 b, \$\i ota\$ Dra b, and {$\gamma$} Cep b), two as brown dwarfs (HD 106252 b and HD 168443 b), and four are low-mass stars (BD\^a\texteuro\textperthousand{} -04 782 b, HD 112758 b, {$\rho$} CrB b, and HD169822 b). Of the others, many are either brown dwarfs or very low mass stars. For \"I{$\mu$} Eri, we derive a solution which is very similar to the one obtained using Hubble Space Telescope data. \textcopyright{} 2011 ESO.},

  abstract = {Context. We have obtained precise radial velocities for a sample of 373 G and K type giants at Lick Observatory regularly over more than 12 years. Planets have been identified around 15 of these giant stars, and an additional 20 giant stars host planet candidates. Aims. We are interested in the occurrence rate of substellar companions around giant stars as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. We probe the stellar mass range from approximately 1 to beyond 3 M{$\odot$}, which is not being explored by main-sequence samples. Methods. We fit the giant planet occurrence rate as a function of stellar mass and metallicity with a Gaussian and an exponential distribution, respectively. Results. We find strong evidence for a planet-metallicity correlation among the secure planet hosts of our giant star sample, in agreement with the one for main-sequence stars. However, the planet-metallicity correlation is absent for our sample of planet candidates, raising the suspicion that a good fraction of them might indeed not be planets despite clear periodicities in the radial velocities. Consistent with the literature results for subgiants, the giant planet occurrence rate increases in the stellar mass interval from 1 to 1.9 M{$\odot$}. However, there is a maximum at a stellar mass of 1.9+ 0.1-0.5 M{$\odot$}, and the occurrence rate drops rapidly for masses larger than 2.5-3.0 M{$\odot$}. We do not find any planets around stars more massive than 2.7 M{$\odot$}, although there are 113 stars with masses between 2.7 and 5 M{$\odot$} in our sample (corresponding to a giant planet occurrence rate smaller than 1.6\% at 68.3\% confidence in that stellar mass bin). We also show that this result is not a selection effect related to the planet detectability being a function of the stellar mass. Conclusions. We conclude that giant planet formation or inward migration is suppressed around higher mass stars, possibly because of faster disk depletion coupled with a longer migration timescale.},

  abstract = {The CARMENES radial velocity (RV) survey is observing 324 M dwarfs to search for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the survey sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M dwarf. These spectra cover the wavelength range 520\textendash 1710 nm at a resolution of at least R \textbackslash textgreater80 000, and we measure its RV, H {$\alpha$} emission, and projected rotation velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine the spectroscopic RV information content, Q , and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be reached in the wavelength range 700\textendash 900 nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large amount of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s -1 in very low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use of a 10 m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search for low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar variability. At a 4 m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of 3\textendash 4 m s -1 .},

Planets with M sin i {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4 M J have an eccentricity distribution consistent with that of binary stars, while planets with M sin i {$\lessequivlnt$} 4 MJ are less eccentric than binary stars and more massive planets. In addition, host star metallicities decrease with planet mass. The statistical significance of both of these trends is only marginal with the present sample of exoplanets. To account for these trends, we hypothesize that there are two populations of gaseous planets: the low-mass population forms by gas accretion onto a rock-ice core in a circumstellar disk and is more abundant at high metallicities, and the high-mass population forms directly by fragmentation of a pre-stellar cloud. Planets of the first population form in initially circular orbits and grow their eccentricities later, and may have a mass upper limit from the total mass of the disk that can be accreted by the core. The second population may have a mass lower limit resulting from opacity-limited fragmentation. This would roughly divide the two populations in mass, although they would likely overlap over some mass range. If most objects in the second population form before the pre-stellar cloud becomes highly opaque, they would have to be initially located in orbits larger than {$\sim$}30 AU, and would need to migrate to the much smaller orbits in which they are observed. The higher mean orbital eccentricity of the second population might be caused by the larger required intervals of radial migration, and the brown dwarf desert might be due to the inability of high-mass brown dwarfs to migrate inwards sufficiently in radius. \textcopyright{} ESO 2007.},

We compiled a catalog of 2340 spectroscopically-confirmed members of these nearby associations. We analyzed their spectral energy distributions and searched for excess related to the presence of protoplanetary disks in a homogeneous way. Sensitivity limits and spatial completeness were also considered. We derive disk fractions as probed by mid-infrared excess in these regions. The unprecedented size of our sample allows us to confirm the timescale of disk decay reported in the literature and to find new trends. The fraction of excess sources increases systematically if measured at longer wavelengths. Disk percentages derived using different wavelength ranges should therefore be compared with caution. The dust probed at 22-24 um evolves slower than that probed at shorter wavelengths (3.4-12 um). Assuming an exponential decay, we derive a timescale tau=4.2-5.8 Myr at 22-24 um for primordial disks, compared to 2-3 Myr at shorter wavelength (3.4-12 um). Primordial disks disappear around 10 Myr, matching in time a brief increase of the number of 'evolved' disks. The increase in timescale of excess decay at longer wavelength is compatible with inside-out disk clearing scenarios. The increased timescale of decay and larger dispersion in the distribution of disk fractions at 22-24 um suggest that the inner and outer zones evolve differently, the latter potentially following a variety of evolutionary paths. The drop of primordial disks and the coincident rise of evolved disks at 10 Myr are compatible with planet formation theories suggesting that the disappearance of the gas is immediately followed by the dynamical stirring of the disk.},

Methods: We update the protoplanetary disk fractions presented in our recent work (Paper I of this series) derived for 22 nearby (\textbackslash textless500 pc) associations between 1 and 100 Myr. We use a subsample of 1428 spectroscopically confirmed members to study the impact of stellar mass on protoplanetary disk evolution. We divide this sample into two stellar mass bins (2 M{$\odot$} boundary) and two age bins (3 Myr boundary), and use infrared excesses over the photospheric emission to classify objects in three groups: protoplanetary disks, evolved disks, and diskless. The homogeneous analysis and bias corrections allow for a statistically significant inter-comparison of the obtained results. Results: We find robust statistical evidence of disk evolution dependence with stellar mass. Our results, combined with previous studies on disk evolution, confirm that protoplanetary disks evolve faster and/or earlier around high-mass (\textbackslash textgreater2 M{$\odot$}) stars. We also find a roughly constant level of evolved disks throughout the whole age and stellar mass spectra. Conclusions: We conclude that protoplanetary disk evolution depends on stellar mass. Such a dependence could have important implications for gas giant planet formation and migration, and could contribute to explaining the apparent paucity of hot Jupiters around high-mass stars.

  abstract = {Barnard's star is a red dwarf, and has the largest proper motion (apparent motion across the sky) of all known stars. At a distance of 1.8 parsecs 1 , it is the closest single star to the Sun; only the three stars in the {$\alpha$} Centauri system are closer. Barnard's star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known 2,3 and has an estimated age older than the Solar System. Its properties make it a prime target for planetary searches; various techniques with different sensitivity limits have been used previously, including radial-velocity imaging 4\textendash 6 , astrometry 7,8 and direct imaging 9 , but all ultimately led to negative or null results. Here we combine numerous measurements from high-precision radial-velocity instruments, revealing the presence of a low-amplitude periodic signal with a period of 233 days. Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as an analysis of instrumental systematic effects, suggest that this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate planet around Barnard's star is a cold super-Earth, with a minimum mass of 3.2 times that of Earth, orbiting near its snow line (the minimum distance from the star at which volatile compounds could condense). The combination of all radial-velocity datasets spanning 20 years of measurements additionally reveals a long-term modulation that could arise from a stellar magnetic-activity cycle or from a more distant planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the candidate planet has a maximum angular separation of 220 milliarcseconds from Barnard's star, making it an excellent target for direct imaging and astrometric observations in the future.},

We then apply this blind search procedure in a proof-of-concept survey of TESS Sectors 18 and 19, which extend through a portion of the galactic plane in the Northern Hemisphere. We search for dim objects at geocentric distances \$d=70-800\$ au in a targeted search for Planet Nine and any previously unknown detached Kuiper belt objects that may shed light on the Planet Nine hypothesis. With no input orbital information, our present pipeline can reliably recover the signals of distant solar system bodies in the galactic plane with \$V\textbackslash textless21\$ and current distances \$d\textbackslash backslashlesssim 150\$ au, and we elaborate on paths forward to push these limits in future optimizations. The methods described in this paper will serve as a foundation for an all-sky shift-stacking survey of the distant solar system with TESS.},

  abstract = {Photometric detections of dust circumstellar discs around pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, coupled with estimates of stellar ages, provide constraints on the time available for planet formation. Most previous studies on disc longevity, starting with Haisch, Lada \& Lada, use star samples from PMS clusters but do not consider data sets with homogeneous photometric sensitivities and/or ages placed on a uniform time-scale. Here we conduct the largest study to date of the longevity of inner dust discs using X-ray and 1-8 {$\mu$}m infrared photometry from the MYStIX and SFiNCs projects for 69 young clusters in 32 nearby star-forming regions with ages t {$\leq$} 5Myr. Cluster ages are derived by combining the empirical AgeJX method with PMS evolutionary models, which treat dynamo-generated magnetic fields in different ways. Leveraging X-ray data to identify disc-free objects, we impose similar stellar mass sensitivity limits for disc-bearing and disc-free young stellar objectswhile extending the analysis to stellar masses as low as M {$\sim$} 0.1 M{$\odot$}. We find that the disc longevity estimates are strongly affected by the choice of PMS evolutionarymodel. Assuming a disc fraction of 100 per cent at zero age, the inferred disc half-life changes significantly, from t1/2 {$\sim$} 1.3-2 Myr to t1/2 {$\sim$} 3.5 Myr when switching from non-magnetic to magnetic PMS models. In addition, we find no statistically significant evidence that disc fraction varies with stellar mass within the first few Myr of life for stars with masses \textbackslash textless 2 M{$\odot$}, but our samples may not be complete for more massive stars. The effects of initial disc fraction and star-forming environment are also explored.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

Keck Observatory reveals evidence for a third planet orbiting the nearby (4.69 pc) dM4 star GJ 876. The residuals of three-body Newtonian fits, which include GJ 876 and Jupiter mass companions b and c, show significant power at a periodicity of 1.9379 days. Self-consistently fitting the radial velocity data with a model that includes an additional body with this period significantly improves the quality of the fit. These four-body (three-planet) Newtonian fits find that the minimum mass of companion ``d'' is m sin i = 5.89 +- 0.54 Earth masses and that its orbital period is 1.93776 (+- 7x10\^-5) days. Assuming coplanar orbits, an inclination of the GJ 876 planetary system to the plane of the sky of {$\sim$} 50 degrees gives the best fit. This inclination yields a mass for companion d of m = 7.53 +- 0.70 Earth masses, making it by far the lowest mass companion yet found around a main sequence star other than our Sun. Precise photometric observations at Fairborn Observatory confirm low-level brightness variability in GJ 876 and provide the first explicit determination of the star's 96.7-day rotation period. Even higher precision short-term photometric measurements obtained at Las Campanas imply that planet d does not transit GJ 876.},

  abstract = {Statistical studies of astronomical data sets, in particular of cataloged properties for discrete objects, are central to astrophysics. One cannot model those objects' population properties or incidences without a quantitative understanding of the conditions under which these objects ended up in a catalog or sample, the sample's selection function. As systematic and didactic introductions to this topic are scarce in the astrophysical literature, we aim to provide one, addressing generically the following questions: What is a selection function? What arguments \$\textbackslash backslashvec\{q\}\$ should a selection function depend on? Over what domain must a selection function be defined? What approximations and simplifications can be made? And, how is a selection function used in `modelling'? We argue that volume-complete samples, with the volume drastically curtailed by the faintest objects, reflect a highly sub-optimal selection function that needlessly reduces the number of bright and usually rare objects in the sample. We illustrate these points by a worked example, deriving the space density of white dwarfs (WD) in the Galactic neighbourhood as a function of their luminosity and Gaia color, \$\textbackslash backslashPhi\_0(M\_G,B-R)\$ in [mag\$\^\{-2\}\$pc\$\^\{-3\}\$]. We construct a sample of \$10\^5\$ presumed WDs through straightforward selection cuts on the Gaia EDR3 catalog, in magnitude, color, parallax, and astrometric fidelity \$\textbackslash backslashvec\{q\}=(m\_G,B-R,\textbackslash backslashvarpi,p\_\{af\})\$. We then combine a simple model for \$\textbackslash backslashPhi\_0\$ with the effective survey volume derived from this selection function \$S\_C(\textbackslash backslashvec\{q\})\$ to derive a detailed and robust estimate of \$\textbackslash backslashPhi\_0(M\_G,B-R)\$. This resulting white dwarf luminosity-color function \$\textbackslash backslashPhi\_0(M\_G,B-R)\$ differs dramatically from the initial number density distribution in the luminosity-color plane: by orders of magnitude in density and by four magnitudes in density peak location.},

These remote observations provide a rigorous validation of whole-disk Earth model simulations used to better understand remotely detectable extrasolar planet characteristics. We have used these data to upgrade, correct, and validate the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model. This comprehensive model now includes specular reflectance from the ocean and explicitly includes atmospheric effects such as Rayleigh scattering, gas absorption, and temperature structure. We have used this model to generate spatially and temporally resolved synthetic spectra and images of Earth for the dates of EPOXI observation. Model parameters were varied to yield an optimum fit to the data. We found that a minimum spatial resolution of 100 pixels on the visible disk, and four categories of water clouds, which were defined by using observed cloud positions and optical thicknesses, were needed to yield acceptable fits. The validated model provides a simultaneous fit to Earth's lightcurve, absolute brightness, and spectral data, with a root-mean-square (RMS) error of typically less than 3\% for the multiwavelength lightcurves and residuals of 10\% for the absolute brightness throughout the visible and NIR spectral range. We have extended our validation into the mid-infrared by comparing the model to high spectral resolution observations of Earth from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, obtaining a fit with residuals of 7\% and brightness temperature errors of less than 1-K in the atmospheric window. For the purpose of understanding the observable characteristics of the distant Earth at arbitrary viewing geometry and observing cadence, our validated forward model can be used to simulate Earth's time-dependent brightness and spectral properties for wavelengths from the far ultraviolet to the far infrared. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Moreover, the method extracts all the main planet transit parameters, amplitude, period, phase, and duration. By comparison to the state of the art Gaussian Process methods on both simulations and real data we show that all the transit parameters are determined with an optimal accuracy (no bias and minimum variance), meaning that the GMF method can be used both for the initial planet detection and the follow-up planet parameter analysis.},

  abstract = {Transit photometry of the exoplanet candidate Kepler-1625b has recently been interpreted to show hints of a moon. We aim to clarify whether the exomoon-like signal is really caused by a large object in orbit around Kepler-1625b. We explore several detrending procedures, i.e. polynomials and the Cosine Filtering with Autocorrelation Minimization (CoFiAM). We then supply a light curve simulator with the co-planar orbital dynamics of the system and fit the resulting planet-moon transit light curves to the Kepler data. We employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether a single planet or a planet-moon system is a more likely interpretation of the light curve variations. We carry out a blind hare-and-hounds exercise using many noise realizations by injecting simulated transits into different out-of-transit parts of the original Kepler-1625 data: 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits of a Kepler-1625b-like planet and 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits of this planet with a Neptune-sized moon. The statistical significance and characteristics of the exomoon-like signal strongly depend on the detrending method, and the data chosen for detrending, and on the treatment of gaps in the light curve. Our injection-retrieval experiment shows evidence for moons in about 10\% of those light curves that do not contain an injected moon. Strikingly, many of these false-positive moons resemble the exomoon candidate. We recover up to about half of the injected moons, depending on the detrending method, with radii and orbital distances broadly corresponding to the injected values. A \$\textbackslash backslashDelta\$BIC of -4.9 for the CoFiAM-based detrending indicates an exomoon around Kepler-1625b. This solution, however, is only one out of many and we find very different solutions depending on the details of the detrending method. It is worrying that the detrending is key to the interpretation of the data.},

The five planets were identified from the full frame images and were confirmed through a series of photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations by the \$TESS\$ Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) Working Group. The planets are all Jovian size (R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm P\}\$ = 1.01-1.77 R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$) and have masses that range from 0.85 to 6.33 M\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$. The host stars of these systems have F and G spectral types (5595 \$\textbackslash backslashle\$ T\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm eff\}\$ \$\textbackslash backslashle\$ 6460 K) and are all relatively bright (9 \$\textbackslash textlessV\textbackslash textless\$ 10.8, 8.2 \$\textbackslash textlessK\textbackslash textless\$ 9.3) making them well-suited for future detailed characterization efforts. Three of the systems in our sample (TOI-640 b, TOI-1333 b, and TOI-1601 b) orbit subgiant host stars (log g\$\_*\$ \$\textbackslash textless\$4.1). TOI-640 b is one of only three known hot Jupiters to have a highly inflated radius (R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm P\}\$ \textbackslash textgreater 1.7R\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$, possibly a result of its host star's evolution) and resides on an orbit with a period longer than 5 days. TOI-628 b is the most massive hot Jupiter discovered to date by \$TESS\$ with a measured mass of \$6.31\^\{+0.28\}\_\{-0.30\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$ and a statistically significant, non-zero orbital eccentricity of e = \$0.074\^\{+0.021\}\_\{-0.022\}\$. This planet would not have had enough time to circularize through tidal forces from our analysis, suggesting that it might be remnant eccentricity from its migration. The longest period planet in this sample, TOI-1478 b (P = 10.18 days), is a warm Jupiter in a circular orbit around a near-Solar analogue. NASA's \$TESS\$ mission is continuing to increase the sample of well-characterized hot and warm Jupiters, complementing its primary mission goals.},

  abstract = {The radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets has recently been shown to be bimodal. The photoevaporation model predicted this bimodality. In the photoevaporation scenario, some planets are completely stripped of their primordial H/He atmospheres, whereas others retain them. Comparisons between the photoevaporation model and observed planetary populations have the power to unveil details of the planet population inaccessible by standard observations, such as the core mass distribution and core composition. In this work, we present a hierarchical inference analysis on the distribution of close-in exoplanets using forward-models of photoevaporation evolution. We use this model to constrain the planetary distributions for core composition, core mass and initial atmospheric mass fraction. We find that the core-mass distribution is peaked, with a mean-mass of \$\textbackslash backslashsim 6\$ M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. The bulk core-composition is consistent with a rock/iron mixture that is ice-poor and "Earth-like"; the spread in core-composition is found to be narrow (\$\textbackslash backslashlesssim 16\textbackslash backslash\%\$ variation in iron-mass fraction at the 2\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ level) and consistent zero. This result favours core formation in a water/ice poor environment. We find the majority of planets accreted a H/He envelope with a typical mass fraction of \$\textbackslash backslashsim 4\textbackslash backslash\%\$; only a small fraction did not accrete large amounts of H/He and were "born-rocky". We find four-times as many super-Earths were formed through photoevaporation, as formed without a large H/He atmosphere. Finally, we find core-accretion theory over-predicts the amount of H/He cores would have accreted by a factor of \$\textbackslash backslashsim 5\$, pointing to additional mass-loss mechanisms (e.g. "boil-off") or modifications to core-accretion theory.},

  abstract = {The EUV/X-ray photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss models are both capable of reproducing the bimodality in the sizes of small, close-in exoplanets observed by the Kepler space mission, often referred to as the "radius gap". However, it is unclear which of these two mechanisms dominates the atmospheric mass-loss which is likely sculpting the radius gap. In this work, we propose a new method of differentiating between the two models, which relies on analysing the radius gap in 3D parameter space. Using models for both mechanisms, and by performing synthetic transit surveys we predict the size and characteristics of a survey capable of discriminating between the two models. We find that a survey of \$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim 5 000\$ planets, with a wide range in stellar mass and measurement uncertainties at a \$\textbackslash backslashlesssim 5\textbackslash backslash\%\$ level is sufficient. Our methodology is robust against moderate false positive contamination of \$\textbackslash backslashlesssim 10\textbackslash backslash\%\$. We perform our analysis on two surveys (which do not satisfy our requirements): the California Kepler Survey and the Gaia-Kepler Survey and find, unsurprisingly, that both data-sets are consistent with either model. We propose a hypothesis test to be performed on future surveys which can robustly ascertain which of the two mechanisms formed the radius gap, provided one dominates over the other.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {In this paper we investigate whether Uranus's 98\$\^\{\textbackslash backslashcirc\}\$ obliquity was a byproduct of a secular spin-orbit resonance assuming that the planet originated closer to the Sun. In this position, Uranus's spin precession frequency is fast enough to resonate with another planet located beyond Saturn. Using numerical integration, we show that resonance capture is possible in a variety of past solar system configurations, but that the timescale required to tilt the planet to 90\$\^\{\textbackslash backslashcirc\}\$ is of the order \$\textbackslash backslashsim 10\^\{8\}\$ years; a timespan that is uncomfortably long. A resonance kick could tilt the planet to a significant 40\$\^\{\textbackslash backslashcirc\}\$ in \$\textbackslash backslashsim 10\^\{7\}\$ years if conditions were ideal. We also revisit the collisional hypothesis for the origin of Uranus's large obliquity. We consider multiple impacts with a new collisional code that builds up a planet by summing the angular momentum imparted from impactors. Since gas accretion imparts an unknown but likely large part of the planet's spin angular momentum, we compare different collisional models for tilted, untilted, spinning, and non-spinning planets. We find that two collisions totaling to \$1\textbackslash backslash,M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ is sufficient to explain the planet's current spin state. Finally, we investigate hybrid models and show that resonances must produce a tilt of \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$40\$\^\{\textbackslash backslashcirc\}\$ for any noticeable improvements to the collision model.},

  abstract = {Population synthesis models of planetary systems developed during the last {$\sim$}15 yr could reproduce several of the observables of the exoplanet population, and also allowed us to constrain planetary formation models. We present our planet formation model, which calculates the evolution of a planetary system during the gaseous phase. The code incorporates relevant physical phenomena for the formation of a planetary system, like photoevaporation, planet migration, gas accretion, water delivery in embryos and planetesimals, a detailed study of the orbital evolution of the planetesimal population, and the treatment of the fusion between embryos, considering their atmospheres. The main goal of this work, unlike other works of planetary population synthesis, is to find suitable scenarios and physical parameters of the disc to form Solar system analogues. We are specially interested in the final planet distributions, and in the final surface density, eccentricity and inclination profiles for the planetesimal population. These final distributions will be used as initial conditions for N-body simulations to study the post-oligarchic formation in a second work. We then consider different formation scenarios, with different planetesimal sizes and different type I migration rates. We find that Solar system analogues are favoured in massive discs, with low type I migration rates, and small planetesimal sizes. Besides, those rocky planets within their habitables zones are dry when discs dissipate. At last, the final configurations of Solar system analogues include information about the mass and semimajor axis of the planets, water contents, and the properties of the planetesimal remnants.},

  abstract = {Exterior of ice lines in protoplanetary discs solid particles can grow by direct vapour deposition. The presence of microscopic silicate particles may nevertheless hinder growth to large pebbles, since the available vapour is deposited predominantly on the small grains that dominate the total surface area. Experiments on heterogeneous ice nucleation, performed to understand ice clouds in the martian atmosphere, show that the formation of a new ice layer on a silicate surface requires a substantially higher water vapour pressure than the deposition of water vapour on an existing ice surface. In this paper, we investigate how the difference in partial vapour pressure needed for deposition of vapour on water ice vs. heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains influence particle growth close to the water ice line. We develop and test a dynamical 1D deposition and sublimation model, where we include radial drift, sedimentation and diffusion in a turbulent protoplanetary disc. We find that vapour is deposited predominantly on already ice-covered particles, since the vapour pressure exterior of the ice line is too low for heterogeneous nucleation on bare silicate grains. Icy particles can thus grow to centimetre-sized pebbles in a narrow region around the ice line, whereas silicate particles stay dust-sized and diffuse out over the disc. The inhibition of heterogeneous ice nucleation results in a preferential region for growth towards planetesimals close to the ice line where we find large icy pebbles. The suppression of heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains may also be the mechanism behind some of the observed dark rings around ice lines in protoplanetary discs, as the presence of large ice pebbles outside ice lines leads to a decrease in the opacity there.},

The observed spatial morphology of the 12CO J = 3-2 emission line is asymmetric across the major axis of the disk; the 12CO J = 2-1 line features a much less pronounced, but similar, asymmetry. The J = 2-1 emission from 12CO and its main isotopologues have no resolved spatial asymmetry. We associate this behavior with the direct signature of a vertical temperature gradient and layered molecular structure in the disk. This is demonstrated using both toy models and more sophisticated calculations assuming non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. A model disk structure is developed to reproduce both the distinctive spatial morphology of the 12CO J = 3-2 line as well as the J = 2-1 emission from the CO isotopologues assuming relative abundances consistent with the interstellar medium. This model disk structure has {$\tau$} = 1 emitting surfaces for the 12CO emission lines that make an angle of 15\textdegree{} with respect to the disk midplane. Furthermore, we show that the spatial and spectral sensitivity of these data can distinguish between models that have sub-Keplerian gas velocities due to the vertical extent of the disk and its associated radial pressure gradient (a fractional difference in the bulk gas velocity field of {$\greaterequivlnt$} 5\%). \textcopyright{} 2013.

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Much recent work on planet formation has focused on the growth of planets by accretion of grains whose aerodynamic properties make them marginally coupled to the nebular gas, a theory commonly referred to as "pebble accretion". While pebble accretion can ameliorate some of the issues presented by growth by purely gravitational processes, it has other issues when compared with observations of exoplanetary systems. A particular concern is the preponderance of planets that end their growth as "super-Earths" or "sub-Neptunes", with masses in the range 2-10 \$M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. Once planets reach this mass scale, timescales for growth by pebble accretion are so rapid that ubiquitously ending growth here is difficult. In this work, we highlight this issue in detail using our previously published model of pebble accretion, and also propose a possible solution: feedback between the growing planet's atmosphere and the gas disk inhibits accretion of smaller particle sizes by forcing them to flow around the growing planet instead of being accreted. For reasonable fiducial disk parameters this "flow isolation" will inhibit accretion of all available particle sizes once the planet reaches super-Earth masses. We also demonstrate that the characteristics of this "flow isolation mass" agree with previously published trends identified in the \$\textbackslash backslash\$textit\{Kepler\} planets.},

The discs modelled here use a cooling prescription that mimics a real disc which is only gravitationally unstable in the outer regions. We do this by modelling the cooling using a simplified method such that the cooling time in the outer parts of the disc is shorter than in the inner regions, as expected in real discs. We find that both giant (\textbackslash textgreater M\_Sat) and low mass (\textbackslash textless M\_Nep) planets initially migrate inwards very rapidly, but are able to slow down in the inner gravitationally stable regions of the disc without needing to open up a gap. This is in contrast to previous studies where the cooling was modelled in a more simplified manner where regardless of mass, the planets were unable to slow down their inward migration. This shows the important effect the thermodynamics has on planet migration. In a broader context, these results show that planets that form in the early stages of the discs' evolution, when they are still quite massive and self-gravitating, can survive.},

  author = {Safsten, Emily D. and Dawson, Rebekah I. and Wolfgang, Angie},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Many exoplanets have orbital characteristics quite different from those seen in our own solar system, including planets locked in orbital resonances and planets on orbits that are elliptical or highly inclined from their host star's spin axis. It is debated whether the wide variety in system architecture is primarily due to differences in formation conditions (nature) or due to evolution over time (nurture). Identifying trends between planetary and stellar properties, including stellar age, can help distinguish between these competing theories and offer insights as to how planets form and evolve. However, it can be challenging to determine whether observed trends between planetary properties and stellar age are driven by the age of the system \textendash{} pointing to evolution over time being an important factor \textendash{} or other parameters to which the age may be related, such as stellar mass or stellar temperature. The situation is complicated further by the possibilities of selection biases, small number statistics, uncertainties in stellar age, and orbital evolution timescales that are typically much shorter than the range of observed ages. Here we develop a Bayesian statistical framework to assess the robustness of such observed correlations and to determine whether they are indeed due to evolutionary processes, are more likely to reflect different formation scenarios, or are merely coincidental. We apply this framework to reported trends between stellar age and 2:1 orbital resonances, spin-orbit misalignments, and hot Jupiters' orbital eccentricities. We find strong support for the nurture hypothesis only in the final case.},

Using this hypothesis and the observed luminosity function, the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass is calculated. The total number and mass of stars which have moved off the main sequence is found to be comparable with the total number of white dwarfs and with the total mass of all fainter main-sequence stars, respectively.}

  abstract = {High-contrast imaging surveys for exoplanet detection have shown giant planets at large separations to be rare. It is important to push towards detections at smaller separations, the part of the parameter space containing most planets. The performance of traditional methods for post-processing of pupil-stabilized observations decreases at smaller separations, due to the larger field-rotation required to displace a source on the detector in addition to the intrinsic difficulty of higher stellar contamination. We developed a method of extracting exoplanet signals that improves performance at small angular separations. A data-driven model of the temporal behavior of the systematics for each pixel can be created using reference pixels at a different position, assuming the underlying causes of the systematics are shared across multiple pixels. This is mostly true for the speckle pattern in high-contrast imaging. In our causal regression model, we simultaneously fit the model of a planet signal "transiting" over detector pixels and non-local reference lightcurves describing a basis of shared temporal trends of the speckle pattern to find the best fitting temporal model describing the signal. With our implementation of a spatially non-local, temporal systematics model, called TRAP, we show that it is possible to gain up to a factor of 6 in contrast at close separations (\$\textbackslash textless3\textbackslash backslashlambda/D\$) compared to a model based on spatial correlations between images displaced in time. We show that better temporal sampling resulting in significantly better contrasts. At short integration times for \$\textbackslash backslashbeta\$ Pic data, we increase the SNR of the planet by a factor of 4 compared to the spatial systematics model. Finally, we show that the temporal model can be used on unaligned data which has only been dark and flat corrected, without the need for further pre-processing.},

Using the Kepler FGK planet hosts, we employ approximate Bayesian computation to infer the multiplicity distribution by comparing simulated catalogues to the observed one. After comparing a total of 10 different multiplicity distributions, half of which were two-population models, to the observed data, we find that a single-population model following a Zipfian distribution is able to explain the Kepler data as well as any of the dichotomous models we test. Our work provides another example of a way to explain the observed Kepler multiplicities without invoking a dichotomous planet population. Using our preferred Zipfian model, we estimate that an additional 2393-717+904 planets likely reside in the 1537 FGK Kepler systems studied in this work, which would increase the planet count by a factor of 2.22-0.36+0.46. Of these hidden worlds, 663-151+158 are expected to reside in ostensibly single transiting planet systems, meaning that an additional planet(s) is expected for approximately 1-in-2 such Kepler systems.},

The mean absolute error of the predictions of the trained model is a factor of 2.1 better than the MAE of the predictions of a naive model which draws randomly from dynamically allowable periods and radii. Second, we adapt a model used for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging in computational linguistics to investigate whether planets or planetary systems fall into natural categories with physically interpretable "grammatical rules." The model identifies two robust groups of planetary systems: (1) compact multi-planet systems and (2) systems around giant stars (\$\textbackslash backslashlog\{g\} \textbackslash backslashlesssim 4.0\$), although the latter group is strongly sculpted by the selection bias of the transit method. These results reinforce the idea that planetary systems are not random sequences \textendash{} instead, as a population, they contain predictable patterns that can provide insight into the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

This pressure maximum traps the inward drifting pebbles stopping the accretion of solids onto the core. On the other hand, a large amount of pebbles (\$\textbackslash backslashsim 100M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$) should flow through the orbit of the core until reaching its isolation mass. The efficiency of pebble accretion increases if the core grows in a dust trap of the protoplanetary disc. Dust traps are observed as ring-like structures by ALMA suggesting the existence of global pressure maxima in discs that can also act as planet migration traps. This work aims to reveal how large a planetary core can grow in such a pressure maximum by pebble accretion. In our hydrodynamic simulations, pebbles are treated as a pressureless fluid mutually coupled to the gas via drag force. Our results show that in a global pressure maximum the pebble isolation mass for a planetary core is significantly larger than in discs with power-law surface density profile. An increased isolation mass shortens the formation time of giant planets.},

Our results are in good agreement with an independent study focused on stars hotter than the Sun, as well as with forward modeling simulations incorporating the effects of photoevaporation and a CKS-like selection function.

A few stars with planets were also observed and analysed; namely, HD 6434, HD 13445 (G186), HD 16141, HD 17051 (\$\i ota\$ Hor), HD 19994, HD 22049 ({$\epsilon$} Eri), HD 28185, HD 38529, HD 52265, HD 190228, HD 210277 and HD 217107.

The spectroscopic analysis was done using the same technique as in previous work on the metallicity of stars with planets, thereby permitting a direct comparison of the results. The work described in this paper thus represents the first uniform and unbiased comparison between stars with and without planetary-mass companions in a volume-limited sample. The results show that 1) stars with planets are significantly metal-rich, and 2) that the source of the metallicity is most probably "primordial".

A comparison of our stellar parameters with values of T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] available in the literature shows a remarkable agreement. In particular, our spectroscopic log g values are now very close to trigonometric log g estimates based on Hipparcos parallaxes. The derived [Fe/H] values are then used to confirm the previously known result that planets are more prevalent around metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we confirm that the frequency of planets is a strongly rising function of the stellar metallicity, at least for stars with [Fe/H] \textbackslash textgreater 0. While only about 3\% of the solar metallicity stars in the CORALIE planet search sample were found to be orbited by a planet, this number increases to more than 25\% for stars with [Fe/H] above +0.3. Curiously, our results also suggest that these percentages might remain relatively constant for values of [Fe/H] lower than about solar, increasing then linearly with the mass fraction of heavy elements.

However, no dedicated searches have been conducted so far for very low mass planets orbiting such objects. Only a few cases of low-mass planets orbiting metal-poor stars are thus known. Amongst these, HD 41248 is a metal-poor, solar-type star on the orbit of which a resonant pair of super-Earth-like planets has been announced. This detection was based on 62 radial velocity measurements obtained with the HARPS spectrograph (public data). Aims. We present a new planet search program that is using the HARPS spectrograph to search for Neptunes and super-Earths that orbit a sample of metal-poor FGK dwarfs. We then present a detailed analysis of 162 additional radial velocity measurements of HD 41248, obtained within this program, with the goal of confirming the existence of the proposed planetary system. Methods. We analysed the precise radial velocities, obtained with the HARPS spectrograph, together with several stellar activity diagnostics and line profile indicators. Results. A careful analysis shows no evidence for the planetary system. One of the signals, with a period of {$\sim$}25 days, is shown to be related to the rotational period of the star, and is clearly seen in some of the activity proxies. We were unable to convincingly retrieve the remaining signal (P {$\sim$} 18 days) in the new dataset. Conclusions. We discuss possible causes for the complex (evolving) signals observed in the data of HD 41248, proposing that they might be explained by the appearance and disappearance of active regions on the surface of a star with strong differential rotation, or by a combination of the sparse data sampling and active region evolution. \textcopyright{} ESO, 2014.},

  abstract = {The chemical composition of stars that have orbiting planets provides important clues about the frequency, architecture, and composition of exoplanet systems. We explore the possibility that stars from different galactic populations that have different intrinsic abundance ratios may produce planets with a different overall composition. We compiled abundances for Fe, O, C, Mg, and Si in a large sample of solar neighbourhood stars that belong to different galactic populations. We then used a simple stoichiometric model to predict the expected iron-to-silicate mass fraction and water mass fraction of the planet building blocks, as well as the summed mass percentage of all heavy elements in the disc. Assuming that overall the chemical composition of the planet building blocks will be reflected in the composition of the formed planets, we show that according to our model, discs around stars from different galactic populations, as well as around stars from different regions in the Galaxy, are expected to form rocky planets with significantly different iron-to-silicate mass fractions. The available water mass fraction also changes significantly from one galactic population to another. The results may be used to set constraints for models of planet formation and chemical composition. Furthermore, the results may have impact on our understanding of the frequency of planets in the Galaxy, as well as on the existence of conditions for habitability.},

With a radius of {$\sim$} 2 R and an orbital period of {$\sim$} 33 days, the planet lies in the temperate zone of its host star and receives stellar irradiation similar to Earth. Here we perform radial velocity follow-up observations with the visual channel of CARMENES with the goal of determining the mass and density of the planet. We measure a planetary semi-amplitude of Kb {$\sim$} 3.5 m s-1 and a mass of Mb {$\sim$} 9 M, yielding a bulk density around {$\rho$}b {$\sim$} 4 g cm-3. This indicates a low-mass planet with a composition consistent with a solid core and a volatile-rich envelope. A signal at 9 days was recently reported using radial velocity measurements taken with the HARPS spectrograph. This was interpreted as being due to a second planet. We see a weaker, time and wavelength dependent signal in the CARMENES data set and thus favor stellar activity for its origin. K2-18 b joins the growing group of low-mass planets detected in the temperate zone of M dwarfs. The brightness of the host star in the near-infrared makes the system a good target for detailed atmospheric studies with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {The radii of hot Jupiters are still not fully understood and all of the proposed explanations are based on the idea that these close-in giant planets possess hot interiors. We approach the radius anomaly problem by adopting a statistical approach. We infer the internal luminosity for the sample of hot Jupiters, study its effect on the interior structure, and put constraints on which mechanism is the dominant one. We develop a flexible and robust hierarchical Bayesian model that couples the interior structure of exoplanets to their observed properties. We apply the model to 314 hot Jupiters and infer the internal luminosity distribution for each planet and study at the population level (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it i\}) the mass-luminosity-radius distribution and as a function of equilibrium temperature the distributions of the (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it ii\}) heating efficiency, (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it iii\}) internal temperature, and the (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it iv\}) pressure of the radiative-convective-boundary (RCB). We find that hot Jupiters tend to have high internal luminosity leading to hot interiors. This has important consequences on the cooling rate and we find that the RCB is located at low pressures. Assuming that the ultimate source of the extra heating is the irradiation from the host star, we illustrate that the heating efficiency follows a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with previous results. We discuss our findings in the context of the proposed heating mechanisms and illustrate that ohmic dissipation, advection of potential temperature, and thermal tides are in agreement with certain trends inferred from our analysis and thus all three models can explain aspects of the observations. We provide new insights on the interior structure of hot Jupiters and show that with our current knowledge it is still challenging to firmly identify the universal mechanism driving the inflated radii.},

  abstract = {One core goal of the Kepler mission was to determine the frequency of Earth-like planets that orbit Sun-like stars. Accurately estimating this planet occurrence rate requires both a well-vetted list of planets and a clear understanding of the stars searched for planets. Previous ground-based follow-up observations have, through a variety of methods, sought to improve our knowledge of stars that are known to host planets. Kepler targets without detected planets, however, have not been subjected to the same intensity of follow-up observations. In this paper, we better constrain stellar multiplicity for stars around which Kepler could have theoretically detected a transiting Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. We subsequently aim to improve estimates of the exoplanet search completeness \textendash{} the fraction of exoplanets that were detected by Kepler \textendash{} with our analysis. By obtaining adaptive optics observations of 71 Kepler target stars from the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick Observatory, we detected 14 candidate stellar companions within 4'' of 13 target stars. Of these 14 candidate stellar companions, we determine through multiple independent methods that 3 are likely to be bound to their corresponding target star. We then assess the impact of our observations on exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, finding an increase in occurrence of 6\% (0.9 \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$) for various estimates of the frequency of Earth-like planets and an increase of 26\% (4.5 \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$) for super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. These occurrence increases are not entirely commensurate with theoretical predictions, though this discrepancy may be due to differences in the treatment of stellar binarity.},

  abstract = {The conditions in the protoplanetary disc are determinant for the various planet formation mechanisms. We present a framework which combines self-consistent disc structures with the calculations of the growth rates of planetary embryos via pebble accretion, in order to study the formation of Super-Earths. We first perform 2D hydrodynamical simulations of the inner discs, considering a grain size distribution with multiple chemical species and their corresponding size and composition dependent opacities. The resulting aspect ratios are almost constant with orbital distance, resulting in radially constant pebble isolation masses, the mass where pebble accretion stops. This supports the "peas-in-a-pod" constraint from the Kepler observations. The derived pebble sizes are used to calculate the growth rates of planetary embryos via pebble accretion. Discs with low levels of turbulence (expressed through the \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$-viscosity) and/or high dust fragmentation velocities allow larger particles, hence lead to smaller pebble isolation masses, and the contrary. At the same time, small pebble sizes lead to low accretion rates. We find that there is a trade-off between the pebble isolation mass and the growth timescale with the best set of parameters being an \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$-viscosity of \$10\^\{-3\}\$ and a dust fragmentation velocity of 10 m/s, mainly for an initial gas surface density (at 1 AU) greater than 1000 \$\textbackslash backslashrm\{g/cm\^2\}\$. A self-consistent treatment between the disc structures and the pebble sizes is thus of crucial importance for planet formation simulations.},

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly beheved in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples.},

  abstract = {The streaming instability is a leading candidate mechanism to explain the formation of planetesimals. However, the role of this instability in the driving of turbulence in protoplanetary disks, given its fundamental nature as a linear hydrodynamical instability, has so far not been investigated in detail. We study the turbulence that is induced by the streaming instability as well as its interaction with the vertical shear instability. For this purpose, we employ the FLASH Code to conduct two-dimensional axisymmetric global disk simulations spanning radii from 1 to 100 au, including the mutual drag between gas and dust as well as the radial and vertical stellar gravity. If the streaming instability and the vertical shear instability start their growth at the same time, we find the turbulence in the dust midplane layer to be primarily driven by the streaming instability. The streaming instability gives rise to vertical gas motions with a Mach number of up to {$\sim$}10 -2 . The dust scale height is set in a self-regulatory manner to about 1\% of the gas scale height. In contrast, if the vertical shear instability is allowed to saturate before the dust is introduced into our simulations, then it continues to be the main source of the turbulence in the dust layer. The vertical shear instability induces turbulence with a Mach number of {$\sim$}10 -1 and thus impedes dust sedimentation. Nonetheless, we find the vertical shear instability and the streaming instability in combination to lead to radial dust concentration in long-lived accumulations that are significantly denser than those formed by the streaming instability alone. Therefore, the vertical shear instability may promote planetesimal formation by creating weak overdensities that act as seeds for the streaming instability.},

  abstract = {Context. The properties of protoplanetary discs determine the conditions for planet formation. In addition, planets can already form during the early stages of infall. Aims. We constrain physical quantities such as the mass, radius, lifetime, and gravitational stability of protoplanetary discs by studying their evolution from formation to dispersal. Methods. We perform a population synthesis of protoplanetary discs with a total of 50 000 simulations using a 1D vertically integrated viscous evolution code, studying a parameter space of final stellar mass from 0.05 to 5 M {$\odot$} . Each star-and-disc system is set up shortly after the formation of the protostar and fed by infalling material from the parent molecular cloud core. Initial conditions and infall locations are chosen based on the results from a radiation-hydrodynamic population synthesis of circumstellar discs. We also consider a different infall prescription based on a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse simulation in order to assess the influence of magnetic fields on disc formation. The duration of the infall phase is chosen to produce a stellar mass distribution in agreement with the observationally determined stellar initial mass function. Results. We find that protoplanetary discs are very massive early in their lives. When averaged over the entire stellar population, the discs have masses of {$\sim$}0.3 and 0.1 M {$\odot$} for systems based on hydrodynamic or MHD initial conditions, respectively. In systems characterised by a final stellar mass {$\sim$}1 M {$\odot$} , we find disc masses of {$\sim$}0.7 M {$\odot$} for the ``hydro'' case and {$\sim$}0.2 M {$\odot$} for the ``MHD'' case at the end of the infall phase. Furthermore, the inferred total disc lifetimes are long, {$\approx$}5\textendash 7 Myr on average. This is despite our choice of a high value of 10 -2 for the background viscosity {$\alpha$} -parameter. In addition, we find that fragmentation is common in systems that are simulated using hydrodynamic cloud collapse, with more fragments of larger mass formed in more massive systems. In contrast, if disc formation is limited by magnetic fields, fragmentation may be suppressed entirely. Conclusions. Our work draws a picture quite different from the one often assumed in planet formation studies: protoplanetary discs are more massive and live longer. This means that more mass is available for planet formation. Additionally, when fragmentation occurs, it can affect the disc's evolution by transporting large amounts of mass radially. We suggest that the early phases in the lives of protoplanetary discs should be included in studies of planet formation. Furthermore, the evolution of the central star, including its accretion history, should be taken into account when comparing theoretical predictions of disc lifetimes with observations.},

Because these systems may be difficult to explain in the paradigm of core accretion and disk migration, it has been suggested that they formed in situ within protoplanetary disks with high solid surface densities. The strong connection between giant planet occurrence and stellar metallicity is thought to be linked to enhanced solid surface densities in disks around metal-rich stars, so the presence of a giant planet can be a sign of planet formation in a high solid surface density disk. I formulate quantitative predictions for the frequency of long-period giant planets in these in situ models by translating the proposed increase in disk mass into an equivalent metallicity enhancement. I rederive the scaling of giant planet occurrence with metallicity as Pgp = 0.05+0.02-0.02 \texttimes{} 10(2.1{$\pm$}0.4)[M/H] = 0.08+0.02-0.03 \texttimes{} 10 (2.3{$\pm$}0.4)[Fe/H] and show that there is significant tension between the frequency of giant planets suggested by the minimum mass extrasolar nebula scenario and the observational upper limits. Consequently, high-mass disks alone cannot explain the observed properties of the close-in Kepler multiplanet systems and therefore migration is still important. More speculatively, I combine the metallicity scaling of giant planet occurrence with small planet occurrence rates to estimate the number of solar system analogs in the Galaxy. I find that in the Milky Way there are perhaps 4 \texttimes{} 10 6 true solar system analogs with an FGK star hosting both a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone and a long-period giant planet companion. \textcopyright{} 2014.

  abstract = {The origin of Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of only a few days is still uncertain. It is widely believed that these planets formed near the water-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much smaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified either as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity followed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet that is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a highly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually, tidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is correct, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied by another giant planet interior to the water-ice line. Using the current sample of giant planets discovered with the Doppler technique, we find that hot Jupiters with P\_orb \textbackslash textless 10 days are no more or less likely to have exterior Jupiter-mass companions than longer-period giant planets with P\_orb \textbackslash textgreater= 10 days. This result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the approximate location of the water-ice line. These results are difficult to reconcile with the high-eccentricity migration scenario for hot Jupiter formation.},

  abstract = {Context.               Recent observational findings have suggested a positive correlation between the occurrence rates of inner super-Earths and outer giant planets. These results raise the question of whether this trend can be reproduced and explained by planet formation theory.                                         Aims.               Here, we investigate the properties of inner super-Earths and outer giant planets that form according to a core accretion scenario. We study the mutual relations between these planet species in synthetic planetary systems and compare them to the observed exoplanet population.                                         Methods.               We invoked the Generation 3 Bern model of planet formation and evolution to simulate 1000 multi-planet systems. We then confronted these synthetic systems with the observed sample, taking into account the detection bias that distorts the observed demographics.                                         Results.               The formation of warm super-Earths and cold Jupiters in the same system is enhanced compared to the individual appearances, although it is weaker than what has been proposed through observations. We attribute the discrepancy to warm and dynamically active giant planets that frequently disrupt the inner systems, particularly in high-metallicity environments. In general, a joint occurrence of the two planet types requires intermediate solid reservoirs in the originating protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, we find differences in the volatile content of planets in different system architectures and predict that high-density super-Earths are more likely to host an outer giant. This correlation can be tested observationally.},

  abstract = {Context.               State-of-the-art planet formation models are now capable of accounting for the full spectrum of known planet types. This comes at the cost of an increasing complexity of the models, which calls into question whether established links between their initial conditions and the calculated planetary observables are preserved.                                         Aims.               In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to investigate the relations between clusters of synthetic planets with similar properties and their formation history.                                         Methods.               We trained a Gaussian mixture model on typical exoplanet observables computed by a global model of planet formation to identify clusters of similar planets. We then traced back the formation histories of the planets associated with them and pinpointed their differences. Using the cluster affiliation as labels, we trained a random forest classifier to predict planet species from properties of the originating protoplanetary disk.                                         Results.               Without presupposing any planet types, we identified four distinct classes in our synthetic population. They roughly correspond to the observed populations of (sub-)Neptunes, giant planets, and (super-)Earths, plus an additional unobserved class we denote as ``icy cores''. These groups emerge already within the first 0.1 Myr of the formation phase and are predicted from disk properties with an overall accuracy of {$>$}90\%. The most reliable predictors are the initial orbital distance of planetary nuclei and the total planetesimal mass available. Giant planets form only in a particular region of this parameter space that is in agreement with purely analytical predictions. Including               N               -body interactions between the planets decreases the predictability, especially for sub-Neptunes that frequently undergo giant collisions and turn into super-Earths.                                         Conclusions.               The processes covered by current core accretion models of planet formation are largely predictable and reproduce the known demographic features in the exoplanet population. The impact of gravitational interactions highlights the need for               N               -body integrators for realistic predictions of systems of low-mass planets.},

  abstract = {The Kuiper Belt is a remnant from the early solar system and its size distribution contains many important constraints that can be used to test models of planet formation and collisional evolution. We show, by comparing observations with theoretical models, that the observed Kuiper Belt size distribution is well matched by coagulation models, which start with an initial planetesimal population with radii of about 1 km, and subsequent collisional evolution. We find that the observed size distribution above R {$\sim$} 30 km is primordial, i.e., it has not been modified by collisional evolution over the age of the solar system, and that the size distribution below R {$\sim$} 30 km has been modified by collisions and that its slope is well matched by collisional evolution models that use published strength laws. We investigate in detail the resulting size distribution of bodies ranging from 0.01 km to 30 km and find that its slope changes several times as a function of radius before approaching the expected value for an equilibrium collisional cascade of material strength dominated bodies for R {$\leq$} 0.1 km. Compared to a single power-law size distribution that would span the whole range from 0.01 km to 30 km, we find in general a strong deficit of bodies around R {$\sim$} 10 km and a strong excess of bodies around 2 km in radius. This deficit and excess of bodies are caused by the planetesimal size distribution left over from the runaway growth phase, which left most of the initial mass in small planetesimals while only a small fraction of the total mass is converted into large protoplanets. This excess mass in small planetesimals leaves a permanent signature in the size distribution of small bodies that is not erased after 4.5 Gyr of collisional evolution. Observations of the small Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) size distribution can therefore test if large KBOs grew as a result of runaway growth and constrained the initial planetesimal sizes. We find that results from recent KBO occultation surveys and the observed KBO size distribution can be best matched by an initial planetesimal population that contained about equal mass per logarithmic mass bin in bodies ranging from 0.4 km to 4 km in radius. We further find that we cannot match the observed KBO size distribution if most of the planetesimal mass was contained in bodies that were 10 km in radius or larger simply because their resulting size distribution cannot be sufficiently depleted over 4.5 Gyr to match observations. \textcopyright{} 2013.

  abstract = {We quantify the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation by examining the contributions to atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimal accretion. Giant impacts cause global motion of the ground. Using analytic self-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for isothermal atmospheres with adiabatic index (\$\textbackslash backslashgamma=5/3\$) that the local atmospheric mass loss fraction for ground velocities \$v\_g \textbackslash textless 0.25 v\_\{esc\}\$ is given by \$\textbackslash backslashchi\_\{loss\}=(1.71 v\_g/v\_\{esc\})\^\{4.9\}\$, where \$v\_\{esc\}\$ is the escape velocity from the target. Yet, the global atmospheric mass loss is a weaker function of the impactor velocity \$v\_\{Imp\}\$ and mass \$m\_\{Imp\}\$ and given by \$X\_\{loss\} {$\sim$} 0.4x+1.4x\^2-0.8x\^3\$ (isothermal atmosphere) and \$X\_\{loss\} {$\sim$} 0.4x+1.8x\^2-1.2x\^3\$ (adiabatic atmosphere), where \$x=(v\_\{Imp\}m/v\_\{esc\}M)\$. Atmospheric mass loss due to planetesimal impacts proceeds in two different regimes: 1) Large enough impactors \$m \textbackslash textgreater \textbackslash backslashsqrt\{2\} \textbackslash backslashrho\_0 (\textbackslash backslashpi h R)\^\{3/2\}\$ (25{$\sim$}km for the current Earth), are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, which is \$h/2R\$ of the whole atmosphere, where \$h\$, \$R\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashrho\_0\$ are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 2) Smaller impactors, but above \$m\textbackslash textgreater4 \textbackslash backslashpi \textbackslash backslashrho\_0 h\^3\$ (1{$\sim$}km for the current Earth) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient impactors (per unit impactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower limit and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an equilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere from planetesimals. We conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have played a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the terrestrial planets. (Abridged)},

Solid particles in dense clouds alter their motion through collective effects and back reaction to the gas.

In experiments on board the International Space Station we studied the evolution of a dense granular gas while interacting with air. We observed diffusion of clusters released at the onset of an experiment but also the formation of new dynamical clusters. The solid-to-gas mass ratio outside the cluster varied in the range of about {$\epsilon$}avg{$\sim$}2.5\textendash 60. We find that the concept of gas drag in a viscous medium still holds, even if the medium is strongly dominated in mass by solids. However, a collective factor has to be used, depending on {$\epsilon$}avg, i.e. the drag force is reduced by a factor 18 at the highest mass ratios. Therefore, flocks of grains in protoplanetary disks move faster and collide faster than their constituents might suggest.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of extrasolar gas giants suggest super-stellar C/O ratios in planetary atmospheres, while interior models of observed extrasolar giant planets additionally suggest high heavy element contents. Furthermore, recent observations of protoplanetary disks revealed super-solar C/H ratios, which are explained by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles, enhancing the volatile content of the disk. We investigate in this work how the inward drift and evaporation of volatile rich pebbles influences the atmospheric C/O ratio and heavy element content of giant planets growing by pebble and gas accretion. To achieve this goal, we perform semi analytical 1D models of protoplanetary disks including the treatment of viscous evolution and heating, pebble drift and simple chemistry to simulate the growth of planets from planetary embryos to Jupiter mass objects by accretion of pebbles and gas while they migrate through the disk. Our simulations show that the composition of the planetary gas atmosphere is dominated by the accretion of vapor, originating from inward drifting evaporating pebbles. This process allows the giant planets to harbour large heavy element contents, in contrast to models that do not take pebble evaporation into account. In addition, our model reveals that giant planets originating further away from the central star have a higher C/O ratio on average due to the evaporation of methane rich pebbles in the outer disk. However, planets formed in the outer disk harbor a smaller heavy element content, due to a smaller vapor enrichment of the outer disk compared to the inner disk. Our model predicts that giant planets with low/large atmospheric C/O should harbour a large/low total heavy element content. We further conclude that the inclusion of pebble evaporation is a key ingredient to determine the heavy element content and composition of giant planets.},

Since the expected numbers extrapolating the well-known 10pc census are much lower, nearby Gaia stars need a quality assessment. The 20pc sample of white dwarfs (WDs) had already been verified and completed with Gaia DR2. We aimed to check and complete the 20pc sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) with spectral types \$\textbackslash backslashgtrsim\$M7 and given Gaia DR2 parallaxes. Dividing the Gaia DR2 20pc sample into subsamples of various astrometric and photometric quality, we studied their distribution on the sky, in the \$M\_G\$ vs. \$G\$\$-\$\$RP\$ colour-magnitude diagram (CMD), and as a function of \$G\$ magnitude and total proper motion. After excluding 139 known WDs and 263 known UCDs from the CMD, we checked all remaining \$\textbackslash backslashapprox\$3500 candidates with \$M\_G\textbackslash textgreater14\$mag (used to define UCDs in this study) for the correctness of their Gaia DR2 proper motions. For confirmed UCD candidates we estimated spectral types photometrically using Gaia and near-infrared absolute magnitudes and colours. We failed to confirm new WDs, but found 50 new UCD candidates not mentioned in three previous studies using Gaia DR2. They have relatively small proper motions and tangential velocities and are concentrated towards the Galactic plane. Half of them have spectral types in SIMBAD and/or previous non-Gaia distance estimates that placed them already within 20pc. For 20 of the 50 objects, we estimated photometric spectral types of M6-M6.5, slightly below the classical UCD spectral type limit. However, seven L4.5-L6.5, four L0-L1, five M8.5-M9.5, and three M7-M8 dwarfs can be considered as completely new UCDs discoveries within 20pc based on Gaia DR2. Four M6.5 and two L4.5 dwarfs have high membership probabilities (64\%-99\%) in the ARGUS, AB Doradus, or Carina Near young moving groups. (abbreviated)},

  abstract = {Recently, seven Earth-sized planets were discovered around the M-dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. Thanks to transit-timing variations, the masses and therefore the bulk densities of the planets have been constrained, suggesting that all TRAPPIST-1 planets are consistent with water mass fractions on the order of 10\%. These water fractions, as well as the similar planet masses within the system, constitute strong constraints on the origins of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In a previous work, we outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario. In this paper we investigate this formation scenario in more detail. We used a Lagrangian smooth-particle method to model the growth and drift of pebbles and the conversion of pebbles to planetesimals through the streaming instability. We used the N-body code MERCURY to follow the composition of planetesimals as they grow into protoplanets by merging and accreting pebbles. This code is adapted to account for pebble accretion, type-I migration, and gas drag. In this way, we modelled the entire planet formation process (pertaining to planet masses and compositions, not dynamical configuration). We find that planetesimals form in a single, early phase of streaming instability. The initially narrow annulus of planetesimals outside the snowline quickly broadens due to scattering. Our simulation results confirm that this formation pathway indeed leads to similarly-sized planets and is highly efficient in turning pebbles into planets. Our results suggest that the innermost planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system grew mostly by planetesimal accretion at an early time, whereas the outermost planets were initially scattered outwards and grew mostly by pebble accretion. The water content of planets resulting from our simulations is on the order of 10\%, and our results predict a ``V-shaped'' trend in the planet water fraction with orbital distance: from relatively high (innermost planets) to relatively low (intermediate planets) to relatively high (outermost planets).},

A spectrophotometric analysis of the rock's inclusions provides clues to CC group membership. Inclusions are generally brighter than the matrix. The dominant variation in their color is a change of the visible spectral slope, with many inclusions being either red or blue. Spectral variation in the red channel hints at the presence of the 0.7{$\sim\$\backslash$}backslashmu\$m absorption band linked to hydrated phyllosilicates. The inclusions are unusually large for a CC; we find that their size distribution may best match that of the Renazzo (CR2) and Leoville (CV3) meteorites. The Ryugu rock does not easily fit into any of the CC groups, consistent with the idea that typical Ryugu-type meteorites are too fragile to survive atmospheric entry.},

  abstract = {Circumplanetary discs (CPDs) form around young gas giants and are thought to be the sites of moon formation as well as an intermediate reservoir of gas that feeds the growth of the gas giant. How the physical properties of such CPDs are affected by the planetary mass and the overall opacity is relatively poorly understood. In order to clarify this, we use the global radiation hydrodynamics code FARGOCA, with a grid structure that allows resolving the planetary gravitational potential sufficiently well for a CPD to form. We then study the gas flows and density/temperature structures that emerge as a function of planet mass, opacity and potential depth. Our results indicate interesting structure formation for Jupiter-mass planets at low opacities, which we subsequently analyse in detail. Using an opacity level that is 100 times lower than that of ISM dust, our Jupiter-mass protoplanet features an envelope that is sufficiently cold for a CPD to form, and a free-fall region separating the CPD and the circumstellar disc emerges. Interestingly, this free-fall region appears to be a result of supersonic erosion of outer envelope material, as opposed to the static structure formation that one would expect at low opacities. Our analysis reveals that the planetary spiral arms seem to pose a significant pressure barrier that needs to be overcome through radiative cooling in order for gas to free-fall onto the CPD. The circulation inside the CPD is near-keplerian and modified by the presence of CPD spiral arms. The same is true when we deepen the planetary potential depth, which in turn increases the planetary luminosity, quenches the formation of a free-fall region and decreases the rotation speed of the envelope by 10\%. For high opacities we recover results from the literature, finding an essentially featureless hot envelope. With this work, we demonstrate the first simulation and analysis of a complete detachment process of a protoplanet from its parent disc in a 3D radiation hydrodynamics setting.},

  abstract = {The bulk density of a planet, as measured by mass and radius, is a result of planet structure and composition. Relative proportions of iron core, rocky mantle, and gaseous envelopes are degenerate for a given density. This degeneracy is reduced for rocky planets without significant gaseous envelopes when the structure is assumed to be a differentiated iron core and rocky mantle, in which the core mass fraction (CMF) is a first-order description of a planet's bulk composition. A rocky planet's CMF may be derived both from bulk density and by assuming the planet reflects the host star's major rock-building elemental abundances (Fe, Mg, and Si). Contrasting CMF measures, therefore, shed light on the outcome diversity of planet formation from processes including mantle stripping, out-gassing, and/or late-stage volatile delivery. We present a statistically rigorous analysis of the consistency of these two CMF measures accounting for observational uncertainties of planet mass and radius and host-star chemical abundances. We find that these two measures are unlikely to be resolvable as statistically different unless the bulk density CMF is at least 40\% greater than or 50\% less than the CMF as inferred from the host star. Applied to 11 probable rocky exoplanets, Kepler-107c has a CMF as inferred from bulk density that is significantly greater than the inferred CMF from its host star (2\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$) and is therefore likely an iron-enriched super-Mercury. K2-229b, previously described as a super-Mercury, however, does not meet the threshold for a super-Mercury at a 1- or 2- \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ level.},

The most observationally accessible rocky planet atmospheres are those dominated by molecular hydrogen gas, because the low density of H2-gas leads to an expansive atmosphere. The capability of life to withstand such exotic environments, however, has not been tested in this context. We demonstrate that single-celled microorganisms (E. coli and yeast) that normally do not inhabit H2-dominated environments can survive and grow in a 100\% H2 atmosphere. We also describe the astonishing diversity of dozens of different gases produced by E. coli, including many already proposed as potential biosignature gases (e.g., nitrous oxide, ammonia, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and isoprene). This work demonstrates the utility of lab experiments to better identify which kinds of alien environments can host some form of possibly detectable life.},

SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) aims to perform a transit search on the nearest (\textbackslash textless 40 pc) ultracool (\textbackslash textless 3000K) dwarf stars. The project's main motivation is to discover potentially habitable planets well-suited for detailed atmospheric characterisation with upcoming giant telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and European Large Telescope (ELT). The project is based on a network of 1m robotic telescopes, namely the four ones of the SPECULOOS-Southern Observatory (SSO) in Cerro Paranal, Chile, one telescope of the SPECULOOS-Northern Observatory (SNO) in Tenerife, and the SAINTEx telescope in San Pedro Martir, Mexico. The prototype survey of the SPECULOOS project on the 60 cm TRAPPIST telescope (Chile) discovered the TRAPPIST-1 system, composed of seven temperate Earth-sized planets orbiting a nearby (12 pc) Jupiter-sized star. In this paper, we review the current status of SPECULOOS, its first results, the plans for its development, and its connection to the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and JWST.},

  abstract = {Context. One of the most promising avenues for the detailed study of temperate Earth-sized exoplanets is the detection of such planets in transit in front of stars that are small and near enough to make it possible to carry out a thorough atmospheric characterisation with next-generation telescopes, such as the James Webb Space telescope (JWST) or Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). In this context, the TRAPPIST-1 planets form a unique benchmark system that has garnered the interest of a large scientific community. Aims. The SPECULOOS survey is an exoplanet transit survey targeting a volume-limited (40 pc) sample of ultracool dwarf stars (of spectral type M7 and later) that is based on a network of robotic 1 m telescopes especially designed for this survey. The strategy for brighter and earlier targets leverages on the synergy with the ongoing TESS space-based exoplanet transit survey. Methods. We define the SPECULOOS target list as the sum of three non-overlapping sub-programmes incorporating the latest type objects (Teff {$\lessequivlnt$} 3000 K). Programme 1 features 365 dwarfs that are small and near enough to make it possible to detail atmospheric characterisation of an 'Earth-like' planet with the upcoming JWST. Programme 2 features 171 dwarfs of M5-type and later for which a significant detection of a planet similar to TRAPPIST-1b should be within reach of TESS. Programme 3 features 1121 dwarfs that are later than M6-type. These programmes form the basis of our statistical census of short-period planets around ultracool dwarf stars. Results. Our compound target list includes 1657 photometrically classified late-type dwarfs, with 260 of these targets classified, for the first time, as possible nearby ultracool dwarf stars. Our general observational strategy was to monitor each target between 100 and 200 h with our telescope network, making efficient use of the synergy with TESS for our Programme 2 targets and a proportion of targets in our Programme 1. Conclusions. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we expect to detect up to a few dozen temperate, rocky planets. We also expect a number of them to prove amenable for atmospheric characterisation with JWST and other future giant telescopes, which will substantially improve our understanding of the planetary population of the latest-type stars.},

  abstract = {Context.Thanks to remarkable progress, radial velocity surveys are now able to detect terrestrial planets at habitable distance from low-mass stars. Recently, two planets with minimum masses below 10 have been reported in a triple system around the M-type star Gliese 581. These planets are found at orbital distances comparable to the location of the boundaries of the habitable zone of their star. Aims.In this study, we assess the habitability of planets Gl 581c and Gl 581d (assuming that their actual masses are close to their minimum masses) by estimating the locations of the habitable-zone boundaries of the star and discussing the uncertainties affecting their determination. An additional purpose of this paper is to provide simplified formulae for estimating the edges of the habitable zone. These may be used to evaluate the astrobiological potential of terrestrial exoplanets that will hopefully be discovered in the near future.Methods.Using results from radiative-convective atmospheric models and constraints from the evolution of Venus and Mars, we derive theoretical and empirical habitable distances for stars of F, G, K, and M spectral types. Results.Planets Gl 581c and Gl 581d are near to, but outside, what can be considered as the conservative habitable zone. Planet "c" receives 30\% more energy from its star than Venus from the Sun, with an increased radiative forcing caused by the spectral energy distribution of Gl 581. This planet is thus unlikely to host liquid water, although its habitability cannot be positively ruled out by theoretical models due to uncertainties affecting cloud properties and cloud cover. Highly reflective clouds covering at least 75\% of the day side of the planet could indeed prevent the water reservoir from being entirely vaporized. Irradiation conditions of planet "d" are comparable to those of early Mars, which is known to have hosted surface liquid water. Thanks to the greenhouse effect of CO-ice clouds, also invoked to explain the early Martian climate, planet "d" might be a better candidate for the first exoplanet known to be potentially habitable. A mixture of several greenhouse gases could also maintain habitable conditions on this planet, although the geochemical processes that could stabilize such a super-greenhouse atmosphere are still unknown. . \textcopyright{} 2007 ESO.},

Compared to ground-based astronomy, these advantages are not just in the accessibility of wavelength ranges where the Earth's atmosphere is opaque, but also in stable, high precision photometry, long-term monitoring and improved areal coverage. Astronomy has a long history of new observational parameter spaces leading to major discoveries. Here we discuss the potential for small satellites to explore new parameter spaces in astrophysics, drawing on examples from current and proposed missions, and spanning a wide range of science goals from binary stars, exoplanets and solar system science to the early Universe and fundamental physics.},

We demonstrate that this model captures the general features of the outcome of the planet formation process around GK stars, and provides an infrastructure to use the \$Kepler\$ results to constrain analytic planet distribution models. We report an increased mean and variance in the marginal posterior distributions for the number of planets per \$GK\$ star when including planet radius measurement uncertainties. We estimate the number of planets-per-\$GK\$ star between 0.75 and 2.5 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ and 50 to 300 day orbital periods to have a \$68\textbackslash backslash\%\$ credible interval of \$0.49\$ to \$0.77\$ and a posterior mean of \$0.63\$. This posterior has a smaller mean and a larger variance than the occurrence rate calculated in this work and in Burke et al. (2015) for the same parameter space using the \$Q1-Q16\$ (previous \$Kepler\$ planet candidate and stellar catalog), and a larger mean and variance than when using the \$DR25\$ (latest \$Kepler\$ planet candidate and stellar catalog). We find that the accuracy and precision of our hierarchical Bayesian model posterior distributions are less sensitive to the total number of planets in the sample, and more so on the characteristics of the catalog completeness and reliability and the span of the planet parameter space.},

  abstract = {To avoid known difficulties in planetesimal formation such as the drift or fragmentation barriers, many scenarios have been proposed. However, in these scenarios, planetesimals form in general only at some specific locations in protoplanetary discs. On the other hand, it is generally assumed in planet formation models and population synthesis models, that planetesimals are broadly distributed in the protoplanetary disc. Here we propose a new scenario in which planetesimals can form in broad areas of the discs. Planetesimals form at the gas pressure bump formed by a first-generation planet (e.g. formed by pebble accretion) and the formation region spreads inward in the disc as the planet migrates. We use a simple 1D Lagrangian particle model to calculate the radial distribution of pebbles in the gas disc perturbed by a migrating embedded planet. We consider that planetesimals form by streaming instability at the points where the pebble-to-gas density ratio on the mid-plane becomes larger than unity. We also study the effect of some key parameters like the ones of the gas disc model, the pebble mass flux, the migration speed of the planet, and the strength of turbulence. We find that planetesimals form in wide areas of the discs provided the flux of pebbles is typical and the turbulence is not too strong. The planetesimal surface density depends on the pebble mass flux and the migration speed of the planet. The total mass of the planetesimals and the orbital position of the formation area depend strongly on the pebble mass flux. We also find that the profile of the planetesimal surface density and its slope can be estimated by very simple equations. We show that our new scenario can explain the formation of planetesimals in broad areas. The simple estimates we provide for the planetesimal surface density profile can be used as initial conditions for population synthesis models.},

  abstract = {Planetary climate can be affected by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. In this study, we explored this effect with a one-dimensional (1-D), line-by-line, radiative transfer model to calculate broadband planetary albedos as input to a seasonally varying, 1-D energy balance climate model. A three-dimensional (3-D) general circulation model was also used to explore the atmosphere's response to changes in incoming stellar radiation, or instellation, and surface albedo. Using this hierarchy of models, we simulated planets covered by ocean, land, and water-ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibited a stronger ice-albedo feedback. We found that ice extent was much greater on a planet orbiting an F-dwarf star than on a planet orbiting a G-dwarf star at an equivalent flux distance, and that ice-covered conditions occurred on an F-dwarf planet with only a 2\% reduction in instellation relative to the present instellation on Earth, assuming fixed CO2 (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance required an 8\% reduction in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star required an additional 19\% reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73\% of the modern solar constant. The reduction in instellation must be larger for planets orbiting cooler stars due in large part to the stronger absorption of longer-wavelength radiation by icy surfaces on these planets in addition to stronger absorption by water vapor and CO2 in their atmospheres, which provides increased downwelling longwave radiation. Lowering the IR and visible-band surface ice and snow albedos for an M-dwarf planet increased the planet's climate stability against changes in instellation and slowed the descent into global ice coverage. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where atmospheric CO2 could be expected to be high such that it maintains clement conditions for surface liquid water. We showed that {$\sim$}3-10 bar of CO 2 will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO2 is needed to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star than would be the case for hotter main-sequence stars. \textcopyright{} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

  abstract = {The prospects for the habitability of M-dwarf planets have long been debated, due to key differences between the unique stellar and planetary environments around these low-mass stars, as compared to hotter, more luminous Sun-like stars. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space- and ground-based observatories to measure the likelihood of small planets to orbit in the habitable zones of M-dwarf stars. We now know that most M dwarfs are hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of Jupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a third of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where they have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical studies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the interaction between the spectral energy distribution of M-dwarf stars and the atmospheres and surfaces of their planets. These and other recent results fill in knowledge gaps that existed at the time of the previous overview papers published nearly a decade ago by Tarter et al. (2007) and Scalo et al. (2007). In this review we provide a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of M-dwarf planet occurrence and habitability based on work done in this area over the past decade, and summarize future directions planned in this quickly evolving field.},

The availability of the high-quality data has enabled astrophysical studies not possible before, including, for example, detailed asteroseismic investigations and the study of the exoplanet census including small planets. This has also allowed to study the minute photometric variability following the orbital motion in stellar binaries and star-planet systems which is the subject of this review. We focus on systems with a main sequence primary and a low-mass secondary, from a small star to a massive planet. The orbital modulations are induced by a combination of gravitational and atmospheric processes, including the beaming effect, tidal ellipsoidal distortion, reflected light, and thermal emission. Therefore, the phase curve shape contains information about the companion's mass and atmospheric characteristics, making phase curves a useful astrophysical tool. For example, phase curves can be used to detect and measure the mass of shortperiod low-mass companions orbiting hot fast-rotating stars out of reach of other detection methods. Another interesting application of phase curves is using the orbital phase modulations to look for non-transiting systems, which comprise the majority of stellar binary and star-planet systems. We discuss the science done with phase curves, the first results obtained so far, and the current difficulties and open questions related to this young and evolving subfield.},

Under the hypothesis that they are opened by planets, in this paper we investigate how the minimum planet mass needed to open a gap varies across different stellar host masses and distances from the star. The dependence on the stellar host mass is particularly interesting because, at least in principle, gap opening around low-mass stars should be possible for lower mass planets, giving us a look into the young, low-mass planet population. Using dusty hydrodynamical simulations, we find however the opposite behaviour, as a result of the fact that discs around low-mass stars are geometrically thicker: gap opening around low-mass stars can require more massive planets. Depending on the theoretical isochrone employed to predict the relationship between stellar mass and luminosity, the gap opening planet mass could also be independent of stellar mass, but in no case we find that gap opening becomes easier around low-mass stars. This would lead to the expectation of a lower incidence of such structures in lower mass stars, since exoplanet surveys show that low-mass stars have a lower fraction of giant planets. More generally, our study enables future imaging observations as a function of stellar mass to be interpreted using information on the mass versus luminosity relations of the observed samples.},

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from {$\sim$}40 kilometers to {$\sim$}300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters {$\lessequivlnt$}13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs ({$\lessequivlnt$}1 to 2 kilometers in diameter).

Phosphine has currently no evident production routes on the planet's surface or in its atmosphere. Aims: The aim of this work is to assess the statistical reliability of the line detection by independent re-analysis of the ALMA data. Methods: The ALMA data were reduced as in the published study, following the provided scripts. First the spectral analysis presented in the study was reproduced and assessed. Subsequently, the spectrum was statistically evaluated, including its dependence on selected ALMA baselines. Results: We find that the 12th-order polynomial fit to the spectral passband utilised in the published study leads to spurious results. Following their recipe, five other \textbackslash textgreater10 sigma lines can be produced in absorption or emission within 60 km/s from the PH3 1-0 transition frequency by suppressing the surrounding noise. Our independent analysis shows a feature near the PH3 frequency at a {$\sim$}2 sigma level, below the common threshold for statistical significance. Since the spectral data have a non-Gaussian distribution, we consider a feature at such level as statistically unreliable that cannot be linked to a false positive probability. Conclusions: We find that the published 267-GHz ALMA data provide no statistical evidence for phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary discs are the site of star and planet formation, and their evolution and consequent dispersal deeply affect the formation of planetary systems. In the standard scenario they evolve on timescales {$\sim$}Myr due to the viscous transport of angular momentum. The analytical self-similar solution for their evolution predicts also specific disc isochrones in the accretion rate - disc mass plane. However, photoevaporation by radiation emitted by the central star is likely to dominate the gas disc dispersal of the innermost region, introducing another (shorter) timescale for this process. In this paper, we include the effect of internal (X and EUV) photoevaporation on the disc evolution, finding numerical solutions for a population of protoplanetary discs. Our models naturally reproduce the expected quick dispersal of the inner region of discs when their accretion rates match the rate of photoevaporative mass loss, in line with previous studies. We find that photoevaporation preferentially removes the lightest discs in the sample. The net result is that, counter-intuitively, photoevaporation increases the average disc mass in the sample, by dispersing the lightest discs. At the same time, photoevaporation also reduces the mass accretion rate by cutting the supply of material from the outer to the inner disc. In a purely viscous framework, this would be interpreted as the result of a longer viscous evolution, leading to an overestimate of the disc age. Our results thus show that photoevaporation is a necessary ingredient to include when interpreting observations of large disc samples with measured mass accretion rates and disc masses. Photoevaporation leaves a characteristic imprint on the shape of the isochrone. Accurate data in the accretion rate - disc mass plane in the low disc mass region therefore give clues on the typical photoevaporation rate.},

One key step for the understanding of these worlds is their characterization, which mostly depend on their host stars. Aims. We perform a significant update of the Stars With ExoplanETs CATalog (SWEET-Cat), a unique compilation of precise stellar parameters for planet-host stars provided for the exoplanet community. Methods. We made use of high-resolution spectra for planet-host stars, either observed by our team or found in several public archives. The new spectroscopic parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process (ARES+MOOG). The host star parameters were then merged together with the planet properties listed in exoplanet.eu to perform simple data analysis. Results. We present new spectroscopic homogeneous parameters for 106 planet-host stars. Sixty-three planet hosts are also reviewed with new parameters. We also show that there is a good agreement between stellar parameters derived for the same star but using spectra obtained from different spectrographs. The planet-metallicity correlation is reviewed showing that the metallicity distribution of stars hosting low-mass planets (below 30 M is indistinguishable from that from the solar neighborhood sample in terms of metallicity distribution.},

  abstract = {I calculate the physical properties of 32 transiting extrasolar planet and brown-dwarf systems from existing photometric observations and measured spectroscopic parameters. The systems studied include 15 observed by the CoRoT satellite, 10 by Kepler and five by the Deep Impact spacecraft. Inclusion of the objects studied in previous papers leads to a sample of 58 transiting systems with homogeneously measured properties. The Kepler data include observations from Quarter 2, and my analyses of several of the systems are the first to be based on short-cadence data from this satellite. The light curves are modelled using the jktebop code, with attention paid to the treatment of limb darkening, contaminating light, orbital eccentricity, correlated noise and numerical integration over long exposure times. The physical properties are derived from the light-curve parameters, spectroscopic characteristics of the host star and constraints from five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An alternative approach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star systems is explored and found to give comparable results whilst imposing a much smaller computational burden. My results are in good agreement with published properties for most of the transiting systems, but discrepancies are identified for CoRoT-5, CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the error bars quoted in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital ephemerides are given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic constraints on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the photometric equivalents for HD17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and HAT-P-11. Complete error budgets are generated for each transiting system, allowing identification of the observations best-suited to improve measurements of their physical properties. Whilst most systems would benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD17156, HD80606, HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterized. HAT-P-11 is an exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of some transiting systems are becoming uncertain and they should be re-observed in the near future.

  abstract = {Cool M dwarfs within a few tens of parsecs from the Sun are becoming the focus of dedicated observational programs in the realm of exoplanet astrophysics. Gaia, in its all-sky survey of \textbackslash textgreater109 objects, will deliver precision astrometry for a magnitude-limited (V = 20) sample of M dwarfs. We investigate some aspects of the synergy between the Gaia astrometric data on nearby M dwarfs and other ground-based and space-borne programs for planet detection and characterization. We carry out numerical simulations to gauge the Gaia potential for precision astrometry of exoplanets orbiting a sample of known dM stars within {$\sim$}30 pc from the Sun. We express Gaia detection thresholds as a function of system parameters and in view of the latest mission profile, including the most up-to-date astrometric error model. Our major findings are as follows: (1) it will be possible to accurately determine orbits and masses for Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods in the range 0.2\textbackslash textlessP\textbackslash textless6.0 yr and with an astrometric signal-to-noise ratio {$\zeta$}/{$\sigma$}AL {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10. Given present-day estimates of the planet fraction fp around M dwarfs, {$\approx$}102 giant planets could be found by Gaia around the sample. Comprehensive screening by Gaia of the reservoir of {$\sim$}4 \texttimes{} 105 Mdwarfs within 100 pc could result in {$\sim$}2600 detections and as many as {$\sim$}500 accurate orbit determinations. The value of fp could then be determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent, an improvement by over an order of magnitude with respect to the most precise values available to-date; (2) in the same period range, inclination angles corresponding to quasi-edge-on configurations will be determined with enough precision (a few per cent) so that it will be possible to identify intermediateseparation planets which are potentially transiting within the errors. Gaia could alert us of the existence of 10 such systems. More than 250 candidates could be identified assuming solutions compatible with transit configurations within 10 per cent accuracy, although a large fraction of these (\{ogonek\}85 per cent) could be false positives; (3) for well-sampled orbits, the uncertainties on planetary ephemerides, separation {$\rho\lbrace$}variant\vphantom\{\} and position angle \$\th eta\$\{symbol\} will degrade at typical rates of {$\Delta\rho\lbrace$}variant\vphantom\{\} \textbackslash textless 1 mas yr-1 and {$\Delta\$$}\th eta\$\{symbol\} \textbackslash textless 2\textdegree yr-1, respectively. These are over an order of magnitude smaller than the degradation levels attained by present-day ephemerides predictions based on mas-level precision Hubble Space Telescope/Fine Guidance Sensor astrometry; (4) planetary phases will be measured with typical uncertainties {$\Delta\lambda$} of several degrees, resulting (under the assumption of purely scattering atmospheres) in phase-averaged errors on the phase function {$\Delta\Phi$}({$\lambda$}) {$\approx$} 0.05, and expected uncertainties in the determination of the emergent flux of intermediate-separation (0.3 \textbackslash textless a \textbackslash textless 2.0 au) giant planets of {$\sim$}20 per cent. Our results help to quantify the actual relevance of the Gaia astrometric observations of the large sampleof nearby M dwarfs in a synergetic effort to optimize the planning and interpretation of follow-up/characterizationmeasurements of the discovered systems by means of transit survey programs, and upcoming and planned ground-based as well as space-borne observatories for direct imaging (e.g. Very Large Telescope/Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research, European Extremely Large Telescope/Planetary Camera and Spectrograph) and simultaneous multiwavelength spectroscopy (e.g. Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory, James Webb Space Telescope). \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {We identify and study a number of new, rapidly growing instabilities of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, which may be important for planetesimal formation. The study is based on the recognition that dust-gas mixtures are generically unstable to a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI), whenever the gas, absent dust, supports undamped linear modes. We show that the "streaming instability" is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides simple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for its growth rates and fastest-growing wavelengths. We extend this analysis to more general dust streaming motions and other waves, including buoyancy and magnetohydrodynamic oscillations, finding various new instabilities. Most importantly, we identify the disk "settling instability," which occurs as dust settles vertically into the midplane of a rotating disk. For small grains, this instability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming instability, with a growth rate that is independent of grain size. Growth timescales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disk orbital period, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude larger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate larger masses). This suggests that in the process of settling, dust will band into rings then filaments or clumps, potentially seeding dust traps, high-metallicity regions that in turn seed the streaming instability, or even overdensities that coagulate or directly collapse to planetesimals.},

  abstract = {Recent high-resolution interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths reveal omnipresent substructures, such as rings, spirals, and asymmetries. A detailed investigation of eight rings detected in five disks by the DSHARP survey came to the conclusion that all rings are just marginally optically thick with optical depths between 0.2 and 0.5 at a wavelength of 1.25 mm. This surprising result could either be coincidental or indicate that the optical depth in all of the rings is regulated by the same process. We investigated if ongoing planetesimal formation could explain the "fine-tuned" optical depths in the DSHARP rings by removing dust and transforming it into "invisible" planetesimals. We performed a one-dimensional simulation of dust evolution in the second dust ring of the protoplanetary disk around HD 163296, including radial transport of gas and dust, dust growth and fragmentation, and planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse of sufficiently dense pebble concentrations. We show that planetesimal formation can naturally explain the observed optical depths if streaming instability regulates the midplane dust-to-gas ratio to unity. Furthermore, our simple monodisperse analytical model supports the hypothesis that planetesimal formation in dust rings should universally limit their optical depth to the observed range.},

  abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be conducting a nearly all-sky photometric survey over two years, with a core mission goal to discover small transiting exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars. It will obtain 30-minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with 2-minute cadence observations of 200,000 to 400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the 2-min cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC), including plans to update the TIC with the incorporation of the Gaia second data release in the near future. We also describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL) using that ranking. We discuss additional factors that affect the ability to photometrically detect and dynamically confirm small planets, and we note additional stellar populations of interest that may be added to the final target list. The TIC is available on the STScI MAST server, and an enhanced CTL is available through the Filtergraph data visualization portal system at the URL https://filtergraph.vanderbilt.edu/tess\_ctl.},

  abstract = {A model is presented for enhancing the abundance of solid material in the region of the solar nebula in which Jupiter formed, by diffusive redistribution and condensation of water vapor. A turbulent nebula is assumed with temperature decreasing roughly inversely with the radial distance from the center, and time scales set by turbulent viscosities taken from recent nebular models. The diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates is solved in the limit that the sink of water vapor is condensation within a narrow radial zone approximately 5 AU from the center. Most of the water vapor is extracted from the terrestrial planet-forming zone. This "cold finger" solution is then justified by analytic solution of the diffusion equation in the condensation zone itself and inward and outward of that zone. The length scale over which most of the diffusively transported water vapor condenses is calculated to be {$\sim$}0.4 AU, provided the solids are not redistributed, and the surface density of ice in the formation zone of Jupiter is enhanced by as much as 75. The enhancement in surface density of solids is sufficient to trigger rapid accretion of planetesimals into a solid core along the lines of the model of Lissauer (1987,Icarus 69, 249-265), and hence produce Jupiter by nucleated instability on a time scale of approximately 105 to 106 years. \textcopyright{} 1988.},

  abstract = {The observed properties of giant planets, models of their evolution, and observations of protoplanetary disks provide constraints on the formation of gas giant planets. The four largest planets in our solar system contain considerable quantities of hydrogen and helium; these gases could not have condensed into solid planetesimals within the protoplanetary disk. Jupiter and Saturn are mostly hydrogen and helium, but have larger abundances of heavier elements than does the Sun. Neptune and Uranus are primarily composed of heavier elements. The transiting extrasolar planet HD 149026 b, which is slightly more massive than Saturn, appears to have comparable amounts of light gases and heavy elements. The other observed transiting exoplanets are primarily hydrogen and helium, but may contain supersolar abundances of heavy elements. Spacecraft flybys and observations of satellite orbits provide estimates of the gravitational mo- ments of the giant planets in our solar system, which in turn provide information on the in- ternal distribution of matter within Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Atmospheric thermal structure and heat flow measurements constrain the interior temperatures of these planets. In- ternal processes may cause giant planets to become more compositionally differentiated or al- ternatively more homogeneous; high-pressure laboratory experiments provide data useful for modeling these processes. The preponderance of evidence supports the core nucleated gas ac- cretion model. According to this model, giant planets begin their growth by the accumulation of small solid bodies, as do terrestrial planets. However, unlike terrestrial planets, the giant planet cores grow massive enough to accumulate substantial amounts of gas before the proto- planetary disk dissipates. The primary question regarding the core nucleated growth model is under what conditions can planets develop cores sufficiently massive to accrete gas envelopes within the lifetimes of gaseous protoplanetary disks.},

Jupiter has strong winds extending to perhaps {$\sim$}3,000-km depth that are evident in the odd zonal harmonics of the gravity field. Jupiter's distinctive magnetic field displays some limited local structure, most notably the Great Blue Spot (a region of downward flux near the equator), and some evidence for secular variation, possibly arising from the winds. However, Juno is ongoing; it has not answered all questions and has posed new ones. Juno's mission reveals Jupiter's interior. A core exists but is diluted by hydrogen.

The equations are given in a form convenient for calculations of the early stages of planetary accumulation, when it is necessary to model the planetesimal swarm by the methods of gas dynamics, rather than follow the orbital evolution of individual bodies. To illustrate the relative importance of the various terms of these equations, steady-state velocities of a simple planetesimal population, consisting of two different sizes of bodies, are calculated. Dynamical friction is found to be an important mechanism for transferring kinetic energy from the larger planetesimals to the smaller ones, providing an energy source for the small planetesimals that is comparable to that provided by the viscous stirring process. When small planetesimals are relatively abundant, gas drag and inelastic collisions among the smaller bodies are of comparable importance for dissipating energy from the population. \textcopyright{} 1988.},

  abstract = {Context. The nearby ultra-compact multiplanetary system YZ Ceti consists of at least three planets, and a fourth tentative signal. The orbital period of each planet is the subject of discussion in the literature due to strong aliasing in the radial velocity data. The stellar activity of this M dwarf also hampers significantly the derivation of the planetary parameters. Aims. With an additional 229 radial velocity measurements obtained since the discovery publication, we reanalyze the YZ Ceti system and resolve the alias issues. Methods. We use model comparison in the framework of Bayesian statistics and periodogram simulations based on a method by Dawson and Fabrycky to resolve the aliases. We discuss additional signals in the RV data, and derive the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the stellar activity with a Gaussian process regression model. To constrain the planetary parameters further we apply a stability analysis on our ensemble of Keplerian fits. Results. We find no evidence for a fourth possible companion. We resolve the aliases: the three planets orbit the star with periods of 2.02 d, 3.06 d, and 4.66 d. We also investigate an effect of the stellar rotational signal on the derivation of the planetary parameters, in particular the eccentricity of the innermost planet. Using photometry we determine the stellar rotational period to be close to 68 d and we also detect this signal in the residuals of a three-planet fit to the RV data and the spectral activity indicators. From our stability analysis we derive a lower limit on the inclination of the system with the assumption of coplanar orbits which is imin = 0.9 deg. From the absence of a transit event with TESS, we derive an upper limit of the inclination of imax = 87.43 deg. Conclusions. YZ Ceti is a prime example of a system where strong aliasing hindered the determination of the orbital periods of exoplanets. Additionally, stellar activity influences the derivation of planetary parameters and modeling them correctly is important for the reliable estimation of the orbital parameters in this specific compact system. Stability considerations then allow additional constraints to be placed on the planetary parameters.},

In addition, we independently confirm with CARMENES data the existence of Lalande 21185 b, a planet that has recently been discovered with the SOPHIE spectrograph. All three planets belong to the class of warm or temperate super-Earths and share similar properties. The orbital periods are 14.24 d, 13.67 d, and 12.95 d and the minimum masses are 4.0 {$\pm$} 0.4 M-, 6.9 {$\pm$} 0.9 M-, and 2.7 {$\pm$} 0.3 M- for GJ 251 b, HD 238090 b, and Lalande 21185 b, respectively. Based on the orbital and stellar properties, we estimate equilibrium temperatures of 351.0 {$\pm$} 1.4 K for GJ 251 b, 469.6 {$\pm$} 2.6 K for HD 238090 b, and 370.1 {$\pm$} 6.8 K for Lalande 21185 b. For the latter we resolve the daily aliases that were present in the SOPHIE data and that hindered an unambiguous determination of the orbital period. We find no significant signals in any of our spectral activity indicators at the planetary periods. The RV observations were accompanied by contemporaneous photometric observations. We derive stellar rotation periods of 122.1 {$\pm$} 2.2 d and 96.7 {$\pm$} 3.7 d for GJ 251 and HD 238090, respectively. The RV data of all three stars exhibit significant signals at the rotational period or its first harmonic. For GJ 251 and Lalande 21185, we also find long-period signals around 600 d, and 2900 d, respectively, which we tentatively attribute to long-term magnetic cycles. We apply a Bayesian approach to carefully model the Keplerian signals simultaneously with the stellar activity using Gaussian process regression models and extensively search for additional significant planetary signals hidden behind the stellar activity. Current planet formation theories suggest that the three systems represent a common architecture, consistent with formation following the core accretion paradigm.},

  abstract = {Close-in giant planets represent the most significant evidence of planetary migration. If large exomoons form around migrating giant planets which are more stable (e.g. those in the Solar System), what happens to these moons after migration is still under intense research. This paper explores the scenario where large regular exomoons escape after tidal-interchange of angular momentum with its parent planet, becoming small planets by themselves. We name this hypothetical type of object a \$\textbackslash backslash\$textit\{ploonet\}. By performing semi-analytical simulations of tidal interactions between a large moon with a close-in giant, and integrating numerically their orbits for several Myr, we found that in \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$50 per cent of the cases a young ploonet may survive ejection from the planetary system, or collision with its parent planet and host star, being in principle detectable. Volatile-rich ploonets are dramatically affected by stellar radiation during both planetocentric and siderocentric orbital evolution, and their radius and mass change significantly due to the sublimation of most of their material during time-scales of hundred of Myr. We estimate the photometric signatures that ploonets may produce if they transit the star during the phase of evaporation, and compare them with noisy lightcurves of known objects (\$\textbackslash backslash\$textit\{Kronian\} stars and non-periodical dips in dusty lightcurves). Additionally, the typical transit timing variations (TTV) induced by the interaction of a ploonet with its planet are computed. We find that present and future photometric surveys' capabilities can detect these effects and distinguish them from those produced by other nearby planetary encounters.},

  abstract = {The interior structure of an exoplanet is hidden from direct view yet likely plays a crucial role in influencing the habitability of the Earth analogues. Inferences of the interior structure are impeded by a fundamental degeneracy that exists between any model comprising more than two layers and observations constraining just two bulk parameters: mass and radius. In this work, we show that although the inverse problem is indeed degenerate, there exists two boundary conditions that enables one to infer the minimum and maximum core radius fraction, CRFmin and CRFmax. These hold true even for planets with light volatile envelopes, but require the planet to be fully differentiated and that layers denser than iron are forbidden. With both bounds in hand, a marginal CRF can also be inferred by sampling in-between. After validating on the Earth, we apply our method to Kepler-36b and measure CRFmin = (0.50 +/- 0.07), CRFmax = (0.78 +/- 0.02), and CRFmarg = (0.64 +/- 0.11), broadly consistent with the Earth's true CRF value of 0.55. We apply our method to a suite of hypothetical measurements of synthetic planets to serve as a sensitivity analysis. We find that CRFmin and CRFmax have recovered uncertainties proportional to the relative error on the planetary density, but CRFmarg saturates to between 0.03 and 0.16 once delta rho/rho drops below 1-2 per cent. This implies that mass and radius alone cannot provide any better constraints on internal composition once bulk density constraints hit around a per cent, providing a clear target for observers.},

Their mutual gravitational interactions leads to transit timing variations, from which Grimm et al. (2018) recently measured the planetary masses with precisions ranging from 5\% to 12\%. Using these masses and the \textbackslash textless5\% radius measurements on each planet, we apply the method described in Suissa et al.

Further, we modify the maximum limit to account for the fact that a light volatile envelope is excluded for planets b through f. Only planet e is found to have a significant probability of having a non-zero minimum CRF, with a 0.7\% false-alarm probability it has no core. Our method further allows us to measure the CRF of planet e to be greater than (49 +/- 7)\% but less than (72 +/- 2)\%, which is compatible with that of the Earth. TRAPPIST-1e therefore possess a large iron core similar to the Earth, in addition to being Earth-sized and located in the temperature zone.},

We determine the survey sensitivity as a function of planet-star mass ratio, \$q\$, and projected planet-star separation, \$s\$, in Einstein radius units. We find that the mass ratio function is not a single power-law, but has a change in slope at \$q \textbackslash backslashsim 10\^\{-4\}\$, corresponding to \$\textbackslash backslashsim 20 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ for the median host star mass of \$\textbackslash backslashsim 0.6 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashodot\}\$. We find significant planetary signals in 23 of the 1474 alert events that are well characterized by the MOA-II survey data alone. Data from other groups are used only to characterize planetary signals that have been identified in the MOA data alone. The distribution of mass ratios and separations of the planets found in our sample are well fit by a broken power-law model of the form \$dN\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm pl\}/(d\{\textbackslash backslashrm log\} q\textbackslash backslash d\{\textbackslash backslashrm log\} s) = A (q/q\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm br\})\^n s\^m \textbackslash backslash, \{\textbackslash backslashrm dex\}\^\{-2\}\$ for \$q \textbackslash textgreater q\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm br\}\$ and \$dN\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm pl\}/(d\{\textbackslash backslashrm log\} q\textbackslash backslash d\{\textbackslash backslashrm log\} s) = A (q/q\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm br\})\^p s\^m \textbackslash backslash, \{\textbackslash backslashrm dex\}\^\{-2\}\$ for \$q \textbackslash textless q\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm br\}\$, where \$q\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm br\}\$ is the mass ratio of the break. We also combine this analysis with the previous analyses of Gould et al. and Cassan et al., bringing the total sample to 30 planets. This combined analysis yields \$A = 0.61\^\{+0.21\}\_\{-0.16\}\$, \$n =-0.93\textbackslash backslashpm 0.13\$, \$m = 0.49\_\{-0.49\}\^\{+0.47\}\$ and \$p = 0.6\^\{+0.5\}\_\{-0.4\}\$ for \$q\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm br\}\textbackslash backslashequiv 1.7\textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^\{-4\}\$. The unbroken power law model is disfavored with a \$p\$-value of 0.0022, which corresponds to a Bayes factor of 27 favoring the broken power-law model. These results imply that cold Neptunes are likely to be the most common type of planets beyond the snow line.},

The core accretion theory's runaway gas accretion process predicts a dearth of intermediate-mass giant planets that is not seen in the microlensing results. In particular, the models predict {$\sim$} 10 \texttimes{} fewer planets at mass ratios of 10-4 {$\leq$} q {$\leq$} 4 \texttimes{} 10-4 than inferred from microlensing observations. This tension implies that gas giant formation may involve processes that have hitherto been overlooked by existing core accretion models or that the planet-forming environment varies considerably as a function of host-star mass. Variation from the usual assumptions for the protoplanetary disk viscosity and thickness could reduce this discrepancy, but such changes might conflict with microlensing results at larger or smaller mass ratios, or with other observations. The resolution of this discrepancy may have important implications for planetary habitability because it has been suggested that the runaway gas accretion process may have triggered the delivery of water to our inner solar system. So, an understanding of giant planet formation may help us to determine the occurrence rate of habitable planets.},

  abstract = {For planets other than Earth, particularly exoplanets, interpretation of the composition and structure depends largely on comparing the mass and radius with the composition expected given their distance from the parent star. The composition implies a mass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from electronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth. We lay out a method for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and mass-pressure relations for key, relevant materials whose equation of state (EOS) is reasonably well established, and for differentiated Fe/rock. We find that variations in the EOS, such as may arise when extrapolating from low-pressure data, can have significant effects on predicted mass-radius relations and on planetary pressure profiles. The relations are compared with the observed masses and radii of planets and exoplanets, broadly supporting recent inferences about exoplanet structures. Kepler-10b is apparently "Earth-like," likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth's, nominally 2/3 of the mass of the planet. CoRoT-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an Fe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth's. GJ 1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H 2O and CH4, suggesting an "icy" composition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of H2O. CoRoT-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation, which could be explained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed atmospheric opacity. HAT-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation for hydrogen, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of higher atomic number. CoRoT-3b lies close to the hydrogen relation. The pressure at the center of Kepler-10b is 1.5+1.2-1.0TPa. The central pressure in CoRoT-7b is probably close to 0.8TPa, though may be up to 2TPa. These pressures are accessible by planar shock and ramp-loading experiments at large laser facilities. The center of HAT-P-2b is probably around 210TPa, in the range of planned National Ignition Facility experiments, and that of CoRoT-3b around 1900TPa.},

  abstract = {In the core-accretion model, the nominal runaway gas-accretion phase brings most planets to multiple Jupiter masses. However, known giant planets are predominantly Jupiter mass bodies. Obtaining longer timescales for gas accretion may require using realistic equations of states, or accounting for the dynamics of the circumplanetary disk (CPD) in the low-viscosity regime, or both. Here we explore the second way by using global, three-dimensional isothermal hydrodynamical simulations with eight levels of nested grids around the planet. In our simulations, the vertical inflow from the circumstellar disk (CSD) to the CPD determines the shape of the CPD and its accretion rate. Even without a prescribed viscosity, Jupiter's mass-doubling time is 104 yr, assuming the planet at 5.2 AU and a Minimum Mass Solar Nebula. However, we show that this high accretion rate is due to resolution-dependent numerical viscosity. Furthermore, we consider the scenario of a layered CSD, viscous only in its surface layer, and an inviscid CPD. We identify two planet-accretion mechanisms that are independent of the viscosity in the CPD: (1) the polar inflow - defined as a part of the vertical inflow with a centrifugal radius smaller than two Jupiter radii and (2) the torque exerted by the star on the CPD. In the limit of zero effective viscosity, these two mechanisms would produce an accretion rate 40 times smaller than in the simulation. \textcopyright{} 2014. The American Astronomical Society.

When realistic opacities are considered, only lines from planets \$\textbackslash backslashge\$10 Jupiter-mass can be detected with current instrumentation, highlighting that from most planets one cannot expect detectable emission. This might explain the very low detection rate of H-\$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ from forming planets from observations. While the line emission comes from both the forming planet and its circumplanetary disk, we found that only the disk component could be detected due to extinction. We examined the line variability as well, and found that it is higher for higher mass planets. Furthermore, we determine for the first time, the parametric relationship between the mass of the planet and the luminosity of the hydrogen recombination lines, as well as the equation between the accretion luminosity and hydrogen recombination line luminosities. These relationships for planets appear to be steeper than the analogous relation for young stars, suggesting that the accretion process around planets proceeds differently than around stars.},

  abstract = {We study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellar disks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. Our main objective is to determine the retention efficiency of dust particles, which are the building blocks of the much larger planetesimals. This study takes account of the two-dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the effects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane (higher than a few disk scale heights), the gas rotates faster than the particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag force causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward, carrying small (sized100 lm at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles at intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (e1 mm at 10 AU) move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire vertical direction, the particles have a net inward flux. The magnitude of their radial motion depends on their distance from the central star. At large distances, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a function of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 lm particles have slower velocity than the gas in the majority of the disk (rd100 AU). This differential migration of particles causes size fractionation. Dust disks composed mostly of small particles (sized10 lm) accrete slower than gas disks, resulting in an increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion phase. If the gas disk has a steep radial density gradient or if dust particles sediment effectively to the disk midplane, the net vertically averaged flux of particles can be outward. In this case, the accretion of the dust component is prevented, leading to the formation of residual dust disks after their gas component is severely depleted.},

We show that characterizing the complicated and multi-dimensional stability boundary of tightly packed systems is amenable to machine learning methods. We find that training an XGBoost machine learning algorithm on physically motivated features yields an accurate classifier of stability in packed systems. On the stability timescale investigated (\$10\^7\$ orbits), it is 3 orders of magnitude faster than direct N-body simulations. Optimized machine learning classifiers for dynamical stability may thus prove useful across the discipline, e.g., to characterize the exoplanet sample discovered by the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This proof of concept motivates investing computational resources to train algorithms capable of predicting stability over longer timescales and over broader regions of phase space.},

We present a case study of Kepler-23, a compact three-planet system where constraints from stability, transit timing variations (TTVs), and transit durations can be directly compared. We find that in this tightly packed system, stability can place upper limits on the masses and orbital eccentricities of the bodies that are comparable to or tighter than current state of the art methods. Specifically, stability places 68\% upper limits on the orbital eccentricities of 0.09, 0.04, and 0.05 for planets \$b\$, \$c\$ and \$d\$, respectively. These constraints correspond to radial velocity signals \$\textbackslash backslashlesssim 20\$ cm/s, are significantly tighter to those from transit durations, and comparable to those from TTVs. Stability also yields 68\% upper limits on the masses of planets \$b\$, \$c\$ and \$d\$ of 2.2, 16.1, and 5.8 \$M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, respectively, which were competitive with TTV constraints for the inner and outer planets. Performing this stability constrained characterization is computationally expensive with N-body integrations. We show that SPOCK, the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (Tamayo et al., 2020) is able to faithfully approximate the N-body results over 4000 times faster. We argue that such stability constrained characterization of compact systems is a challenging "needle-in-a-haystack" problem (requiring removal of 2500 unstable configurations for every stable one for our adopted priors) and we offer several practical recommendations for such stability analyses.},

We consider small planets that have no disk gap around their orbits. Eccentricities and inclinations of planets are assumed to be smaller than the disk aspect ratio. This is reasonable for planets with no disk gap. The density wave excited by a planet with nonzero small eccentricity e and inclination i is decomposed into three components: the waves by a planet with e=i=0, the eccentricity waves, and the bending waves. The eccentricity waves are related to the noncircular motion of the planet, while the bending waves are excited by the motion normal to the equatorial plane. In our formulation, these waves are described by the same wave equations, and only the perturbing potentials are different. We numerically solve the wave equations and calculate the force exerted on the planet by the waves. The force is not parallel to the velocity of the epicycle motion. From the force obtained, we also find the evolution rates in the eccentricity, the inclination, and the longitudes of the perihelion and the ascending node. The characteristic evolution time of these orbital elements is about 300(r/1AU)2 yr for Earth-sized planets in the minimum-mass nebula disk. Eccentricity damping is caused by eccentricity waves, while inclination damping is due to bending waves for planets with small eccentricities and inclinations and with no disk gap. This means that to lowest order there is no coupling between the evolutions of the eccentricity and the inclination.},

Thanks to the improvements in resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA, measurements of the surface density of mm-sized grains are now possible on large samples of disks. Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to inform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation. We analyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus star forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine physical properties such as the dust surface density, the disk mass and size and to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations directly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890 micron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out of 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical properties. The sample covers stellar masses between {$\sim$}0.1 and {$\sim$}2 Solar masses, and we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar parameters. We find, instead, a correlation between the integrated sub-mm flux (a proxy for the disk mass) and the exponential cut-off radii (a proxy of the disk size) of the Lupus disks. Comparing these results with observations at similar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature and scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are generally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance. Considering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to tentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous spreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.},

These planets range from Earth-to-Jupiter sized and from {$\sim$}0.1 to 1.0 AU in separation - so-called "warm" planets. Our data processing includes two-pass harmonic detrending, transit timing variations, model selection and careful data quality vetting to produce a grand light curve with a r.m.s. of 5.1 ppm. We find that the occurrence rate of Galilean-analog moon systems can be constrained to be \$\textbackslash backslasheta\textbackslash textless0.38\$ to 95\% confidence for the 284 KOIs considered, with a 68.3\% confidence interval of \$\textbackslash backslasheta=0.16\_\{-0.10\}\^\{+0.13\}\$. A single-moon model of variable size and separation locates a slight preference for a population of Super-Ios, {$\sim$}0.5 R\_Earth moons orbiting at 5-10 planetary radii. However, we stress that the low Bayes factor of just 2 in this region means it should be treated as no more than a hint at this time. Splitting our data into various physically-motivated subsets reveals no strong signal. The dearth of Galilean-analogs around warm planets places the first strong constraint on exomoon formation models to date. Finally, we report evidence for an exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b I, which we briefly describe ahead of scheduled observations of the target with the Hubble Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {We present the first kinematical detection of embedded protoplanets within a protoplanetary disk. Using archival ALMA observations of HD 163296, we demonstrate a new technique to measure the rotation curves of CO isotopologue emission to sub-percent precision relative to the Keplerian rotation. These rotation curves betray substantial deviations caused by local perturbations in the radial pressure gradient, likely driven by gaps carved in the gas surface density by Jupiter-mass planets. Comparison with hydrodynamic simulations shows excellent agreement with the gas rotation profile when the disk surface density is perturbed by two Jupiter mass planets at 83 au and 137 au. As the rotation of the gas is dependent on the pressure of the total gas component, this method provides a unique probe of the gas surface density profile without incurring significant uncertainties due to gas-to-dust ratios or local chemical abundances which plague other methods. Future analyses combining both methods promise to provide the most accurate and robust measures of embedded planetary mass. Furthermore, this method provides a unique opportunity to explore wide-separation planets beyond the mm continuum edge and to trace the gas pressure profile essential in modelling grain evolution in disks.},

  abstract = {One of the most significant revelations from Kepler is that roughly one-third of Sun-like stars host planets which orbit their stars within 100 days and are between the size of Earth and Neptune. How do these super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets form, what are they made of, and do they represent a continuous population or naturally divide into separate groups? Measuring their masses and thus bulk densities can help address these questions of their origin and composition. To that end, we began the Magellan-TESS Survey (MTS), which uses Magellan II/PFS to obtain radial velocity (RV) masses of 30 transiting exoplanets discovered by TESS and develops an analysis framework that connects observed planet distributions to underlying populations. In the past, RV measurements of small planets have been challenging to obtain due to the faintness and low RV semi-amplitudes of most Kepler systems, and challenging to interpret due to the potential biases in the existing ensemble of small planet masses from non-algorithmic decisions for target selection and observation plans. The MTS attempts to minimize these biases by focusing on bright TESS targets and employing a quantitative selection function and multi-year observing strategy. In this paper, we (1) describe the motivation and survey strategy behind the MTS, (2) present our first catalog of planet mass and density constraints for 25 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs; 20 in our population analysis sample, five that are members of the same systems), and (3) employ a hierarchical Bayesian model to produce preliminary constraints on the mass-radius (M-R) relation. We find qualitative agreement with prior mass-radius relations but some quantitative differences (abridged). The the results of this work can inform more detailed studies of individual systems and offer a framework that can be applied to future RV surveys with the goal of population inferences.},

  abstract = {Context. To date, calculations of planet formation have mainly focused on dynamics, and only a few have considered the chemical composition of refractory elements and compounds in the planetary bodies. While many studies have been concentrating on the chemical composition of volatile compounds (such as H2O, CO, CO2) incorporated in planets, only a few have considered the refractory materials as well, although they are of great importance for the formation of rocky planets. Aims: We computed the abundance of refractory elements in planetary bodies formed in stellar systems with a solar chemical composition by combining models of chemical composition and planet formation. We also considered the formation of refractory organic compounds, which have been ignored in previous studies on this topic. Methods: We used the commercial software package HSC Chemistry to compute the condensation sequence and chemical composition of refractory minerals incorporated into planets. The problem of refractory organic material is approached with two distinct model calculations: the first considers that the fraction of atoms used in the formation of organic compounds is removed from the system (i.e., organic compounds are formed in the gas phase and are non-reactive); and the second assumes that organic compounds are formed by the reaction between different compounds that had previously condensed from the gas phase. Results: Results show that refractory material represents more than 50 wt \% of the mass of solids accreted by the simulated planets with up to 30 wt \% of the total mass composed of refractory organic compounds. Carbide and silicate abundances are consistent with C/O and Mg/Si elemental ratios of 0.5 and 1.02 for the Sun. Less than 1 wt \% of carbides are present in the planets, and pyroxene and olivine are formed in similar quantities. The model predicts planets that are similar in composition to those of the solar system. Starting from a common initial nebula composition, it also shows that a wide variety of chemically different planets can form, which means that the differences in planetary compositions are due to differences in the planetary formation process. Conclusions: We show that a model in which refractory organic material is absent from the system is more compatible with observations. The use of a planet formation model is essential to form a wide diversity of planets in a consistent way.},

  abstract = {Context. The chemical composition of planets is an important constraint for planet formation and subsequent differentiation. While theoretical studies try to derive the compositions of planets from planet formation models in order to link the composition and formation process of planets, other studies assume that the elemental ratios in the formed planet and in the host star are the same. Aims. Using a chemical model combined with a planet formation model, we aim to link the composition of stars with solar mass and luminosity with the composition of the hosted planets. For this purpose, we study the three most important elemental ratios that control the internal structure of a planet: Fe/Si, Mg/Si, and C/O. Methods. A set of 18 different observed stellar compositions was used to cover a wide range of these elemental ratios. The Gibbs energy minimization assumption was used to derive the composition of planets, taking stellar abundances as proxies for nebular abundances, and to generate planets in a self-consistent planet formation model. We computed the elemental ratios Fe/Si, Mg/Si and C/O in three types of planets (rocky, icy, and giant planets) formed in different protoplanetary discs, and compared them to stellar abundances. Results. We show that the elemental ratios Mg/Si and Fe/Si in planets are essentially identical to those in the star. Some deviations are shown for planets that formed in specific regions of the disc, but the relationship remains valid within the ranges encompassed in our study. The C/O ratio shows only a very weak dependence on the stellar value.},

  abstract = {Context. Direct observations of gaseous exoplanets reveal that their gas envelope has a higher C/O ratio than that of the host star (e.g., Wasp 12-b). This has been explained by considering that the gas phase of the disc could be inhomogeneous, exceeding the stellar C/O ratio in regions where these planets formed; but few studies have considered the drift of the gas and planet migration. Aims. We aim to derive the gas composition in planets through planet formation to evaluate if the formation of giant planets with an enriched C/O ratio is possible. The study focusses on the effects of different processes on the C/O ratio, such as the disc evolution, the drift of gas, and planet migration. Methods. We used our previous models for computing the chemical composition, together with a planet formation model, to which we added the composition and drift of the gas phase of the disc, which is composed of the main volatile species H2O, CO, CO2, NH3, N2, CH3OH, CH4, and H2S, H2 and He. The study focusses on the region where ice lines are present and influence the C/O ratio of the planets. Results. Modelling shows that the condensation of volatile species as a function of radial distance allows for C/O enrichment in specific parts of the protoplanetary disc of up to four times the solar value. This leads to the formation of planets that can be enriched in C/O in their envelope up to three times the solar value. Planet migration, gas phase evolution and disc irradiation enables the evolution of the initial C/O ratio that decreases in the outer part of the disc and increases in the inner part of the disc. The total C/O ratio of the planets is governed by the contribution of ices accreted, suggesting that high C/O ratios measured in planetary atmospheres are indicative of a lack of exchange of material between the core of a planet and its envelope or an observational bias. It also suggests that the observed C/O ratio is not representative of the total C/O ratio of the planet.},

Of these candidates, 219 are new and include two in multi-planet systems (KOI-82.06 and KOI-2926.05), and ten high-reliability, terrestrial-size, habitable zone candidates. This catalog was created using a tool called the Robovetter which automatically vets the DR25 Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs, Twicken et al. 2016). The Robovetter also vetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEs caused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discusses the Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods less than 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transits that are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars is greater than 85\%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (the fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) is greater than 98\%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and 500 days around FGK dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7\% complete and the catalog is 50.5\% reliable.

  abstract = {The unexpectedly large radii of hot Jupiters are a longstanding mystery whose solution will provide important insights into their interior physics. Many potential solutions have been suggested, which make diverse predictions about the details of inflation. In particular, although any valid model must allow for maintaining large planetary radii, only some allow for radii to increase with time. This reinflation process would potentially occur when the incident flux on the planet is increased. In this work, we examine the observed population of hot Jupiters to see if they grow as their parent stars brighten along the main sequence. We consider the relation between radius and other observables, including mass, incident flux, age, and fractional age (age over main sequence lifetime), and show that main sequence brightening is often sufficient to produce detectable reinflation. We further argue that these provide strong evidence for the relatively rapid reinflation of giant planets, and discuss the implications for proposed heating mechanisms. In our population analysis we also find evidence for a "delayed-cooling effect", wherein planets cool and contract far more slowly than expected. While not capable of explaining the observed radii alone, it may represent an important component of the effect. Finally, we identify a weak negative relationship between stellar metallicity and planet radius which is presumably the result of enhanced planetary bulk metallicity around metal-rich stars and has important implications for planet formation theory.},

  abstract = {The star Kepler-1625 recently attracted considerable attention when an analysis of the stellar photometric time series from the Kepler mission was interpreted as showing evidence of a large exomoon around the transiting Jupiter-sized planet candidate Kepler-1625b. We aim to detect the radial velocity (RV) signal imposed by Kepler-1625b (and its putative moon) on the host star or, as the case may be, determine an upper limit on the mass of the transiting object. We took a total of 22 spectra of Kepler-1625 using CARMENES, 20 of which were useful. Observations were spread over a total of seven nights between October 2017 and October 2018, covering \$125\textbackslash backslash\%\$ of one full orbit of Kepler-1625b. We used the automatic Spectral Radial Velocity Analyser (SERVAL) pipeline to deduce the stellar RVs and uncertainties. Then we fitted the RV curve model of a single planet on a Keplerian orbit to the observed RVs using a \$\textbackslash backslashchi\^2\$ minimisation procedure. We derive upper limits on the mass of Kepler-1625b under the assumption of a single planet on a circular orbit. In this scenario, the \$1\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashsigma\$, \$2\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashsigma\$, and \$3\textbackslash backslash,\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ confidence upper limits for the mass of Kepler-1625b are \$2.90\textbackslash backslash,M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$, \$7.15\textbackslash backslash,M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$, and \$11.60\textbackslash backslash,M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm J\}\$, respectively. We present strong evidence for the planetary nature of Kepler-1625b, making it the 10th most long-period confirmed planet known today. Our data does not answer the question about a second, possibly more short-period planet that could be responsible for the observed transit timing variation of Kepler-1625b.},

  abstract = {Aims. We announce confirmation of Kepler-418b, one of two proposed planets in this system. This is the first confirmation of an exoplanet based primarily on the transit color signature technique. Methods. We used the Kepler public data archive combined with multicolor photometry from the Gran Telescopio de Canarias and radial velocity follow-up using FIES at the Nordic Optical Telescope for confirmation. Results. We report a confident detection of a transit color signature that can only be explained by a compact occulting body, entirely ruling out a contaminating eclipsing binary, a hierarchical triple, or a grazing eclipsing binary. Those findings are corroborated by our radial velocity measurements, which put an upper limit of {$\sim$}1 MJup on the mass of Kepler-418b. We also report that the host star is significantly blended, confirming the {$\sim$}10\% light contamination suspected from the crowding metric in the Kepler light curve measured by the Kepler team. We report detection of an unresolved light source that contributes an additional {$\sim$}30\% to the target star, which would not have been detected without multicolor photometric analysis. The resulting planet-star radius ratio is 0.110 {$\pm$} 0.0025, more than 25\% more than the 0.087 measured by Kepler leading to a radius of 1.20 {$\pm$} 0.16 RJup instead of the 0.94 RJup measured by the Kepler team. Conclusions. This is the first confirmation of an exoplanet candidate based primarily on the transit color signature, demonstrating that this technique is viable from ground for giant planets. It is particularly useful for planets with long periods such as Kepler-418b, which tend to have long transit durations. While this technique is limited to candidates with deep transits from the ground, it may be possible to confirm earth-like exoplanet candidates with a few hours of observing time with an instrument like the James Webb Space Telescope. Additionally, multicolor photometric analysis of transits can reveal unknown stellar neighbors and binary companions that do not affect the classification of the transiting object but can have a very significant effect on the perceived planetary radius. \textcopyright{} 2014 ESO.},

This dynamo process is of great importance in geophysics, planetary science and astrophysics, since magnetic fields are known to play a key role in the dynamics of these systems. This paper gives an introduction to dynamo theory for the fluid dynamicist. It proceeds by laying the groundwork, introducing the equations and techniques that are at the heart of dynamo theory, before presenting some simple dynamo solutions. The problems currently exercising dynamo theorists are then introduced, along with the attempts to make progress. The paper concludes with the argument that progress in dynamo theory will be made in the future by utilising and advancing some of the current breakthroughs in neutral fluid turbulence such as those in transition, self-sustaining processes, turbulence/mean-flow interaction, statistical methods and maintenance and loss of balance.},

In our simulations, planets, which are free to migrate and accrete mass, end up in a locked resonant configuration that is dynamically stable. We show that features observed at infrared (scattered light) and millimetre (thermal continuum) wavelengths are naturally explained by the accretion stream onto the outer planet, without requiring a circumplanetary disc around planet c. We post-processed our near-infrared synthetic images in order to account for observational biases known to affect high-contrast images. Our successful reproduction of the observations indicates that planet-disc dynamical interactions alone are sufficient to explain the observations of PDS 70.},

Previously it has been difficult to interpret the ensemble properties of transiting exoplanets, because of the widely different methodologies that have been applied in individual cases. Furthermore, previous studies often ignored an important constraint on the mean stellar density that can be derived directly from the light curve. The main contributions of this work are 1) a critical compilation and error assessment of all reported values for the effective temperature and metallicity of the host stars; 2) the application of a consistent methodology and treatment of errors in modeling the transit light curves; and 3) more accurate estimates of the stellar mass and radius based on stellar evolution models, incorporating the photometric constraint on the stellar density. We use our results to revisit some previously proposed patterns and correlations within the ensemble. We confirm the mass-period correlation, and we find evidence for a new pattern within the scatter about this correlation: planets around metal-poor stars are more massive than those around metal-rich stars at a given orbital period. Likewise, we confirm the proposed dichotomy of planets according to their Safronov number, and we find evidence that the systems with small Safronov numbers are more metal-rich on average. Finally, we confirm the trend that led to the suggestion that higher-metallicity stars harbor planets with a greater heavy-element content.},

This is often attributed to radial drift and grain growth of the millimetre grains, but line optical depth produces a similar observational signature. Aims. We investigate in which parts of the disc structure parameter space dust evolution and line optical depth are the dominant drivers of the observed gas and dust size difference. Methods. Using the thermochemical model DALI with dust evolution included we ran a grid of models aimed at reproducing the observed gas and dust size dichotomy. Results. The relation between R dust and dust evolution is non-monotonic and depends on the disc structure. The quantity R gas is directly related to the radius where the CO column density drops below 10 15 cm -2 and CO becomes photodissociated; R gas is not affected by dust evolution but scales with the total CO content of the disc. While these cases are rare in current observations, R gas / R dust \textbackslash textgreater 4 is a clear sign of dust evolution and radial drift in discs. For discs with a smaller R gas / R dust , identifying dust evolution from R gas / R dust requires modelling the disc structure including the total CO content. To minimize the uncertainties due to observational factors requires FWHM beam \textbackslash textless 1\texttimes{} the characteristic radius and a peak S/N \textbackslash textgreater 10 on the 12 CO emission moment zero map.

For the gas, any radius enclosing \textbackslash textgreater60\% of the 12 CO flux contains most of the disc mass. Conclusions. To distinguish radial drift and grain growth from line optical depth effects based on size ratios requires discs to be observed at high enough angular resolution and the disc structure should to be modelled to account for the total CO content of the disc.},

  abstract = {The evolution of protoplanetary disks is dominated by the conservation of angular momentum, where the accretion of material onto the central star is driven by viscous expansion of the outer disk or by disk winds extracting angular momentum without changing the disk size. Studying the time evolution of disk sizes allows us therefore to distinguish between viscous stresses or disk winds as the main mechanism of disk evolution. Observationally, estimates of the disk gaseous outer radius are based on the extent of the CO rotational emission, which, during the evolution, is also affected by the changing physical and chemical conditions in the disk. We use physical-chemical DALI models to study how the extent of the CO emission changes with time in a viscously expanding disk and investigate to what degree this observable gas outer radius is a suitable tracer of viscous spreading and whether current observations are consistent with viscous evolution. We find that the gas outer radius (R\_co) measured from our models matches the expectations of a viscously spreading disk: R\_co increases with time and for a given time R\_co is larger for a disk with a higher viscosity alpha\_visc. However, in the extreme case where the disk mass is low (less than 10\^-4 Msun) and alpha\_visc is high (larger than 10\^-2), R\_co will instead decrease with time as a result of CO photodissociation in the outer disk. For most disk ages R\_co is up to 12x larger than the characteristic size R\_c of the disk, and R\_co/R\_c is largest for the most massive disk. As a result of this difference, a simple conversion of R\_co to alpha\_visc will overestimate the true alpha\_visc of the disk by up to an order of magnitude. We find that most observed gas outer radii in Lupus can be explained using a viscously evolving disk that starts out small (R\_c = 10 AU) and has a low viscosity (alpha\_visc = 10\^-4 - 10\^-3).},

We measured the Sloan g{${'}$} magnitudes of the Starlink's STARLINK-1130 (Darksat) and 1113 low Earth orbit (LEO) communication satellites to determine the effectiveness of the Darksat darkening treatment at 475.4 nm. Methods. Two observations of the Starlink's Darksat LEO communication satellite were conducted on 2020/02/08 and 2020/03/06 using Sloan r{${'}$} and g{${'}$} filters, respectively. A second satellite, STARLINK-1113, was observed on 2020/03/06 using a Sloan g{${'}$} filter. The initial observation on 2020/02/08 was a test observation conducted when Darksat was still in the process of manoeuvring to its nominal orbit and orientation. Based on the successful test observation, the first main observation took place on 2020/03/06, along with an observation of the second Starlink satellite. Results. The calibration, image processing, and analysis of the Darksat Sloan g{${'}$} image gives an estimated Sloan g{${'}$} magnitude of 7.46{$\mathscr{l}$} {$\pm\mathscr{l}$} 0.04 at a range of 976.50 km. For STARLINK-1113, an estimated Sloan g{${'}$} magnitude of 6.59{$\mathscr{l}$} {$\pm\mathscr{l}$} 0.05 at a range of 941.62 km was found. When scaled to a range of 550 km and corrected for the solar and observer phase angles, a reduction by a factor of two is seen in the reflected solar flux between Darksat and STARLINK-1113. Conclusions. The data and results presented in this work demonstrate that the special darkening coating used by Starlink for Darksat has darkened the Sloan g' magnitude by 0.77{$\mathscr{l}$} {$\pm\mathscr{l}$} 0.05 mag when the range is equal to a nominal orbital height (550 km). This result will serve members of the astronomical community who are actively modelling the satellite mega-constellations to ascertain their actual impact on both amateur and professional astronomical observations. Both concurrent and subsequent observations are planned to cover the full optical and NIR spectrum using an ensemble of instruments, telescopes, and observatories.},

Measurements of the spin-orbit angle have revealed a surprising diversity, far from the placid, Kantian and Laplacian ideals, whereby planets form, and remain, on orbital planes coincident with their star's equator. This chapter will review a short history of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, how it is modelled, and will summarise the current state of the field before describing other uses for a spectroscopic transit, and alternative methods of measuring the spin-orbit angle.},

We combined new and archival precise Doppler measurements from CARMENES with those available from HIRES for GJ 1148 and modeled these data with a self-consistent dynamical model. We studied the orbital dynamics of the system using the secular theory and direct N-body integrations. The prospects of potentially habitable moons around GJ 1148 b were examined. Results. The refined dynamical analyses show that the GJ 1148 system is long-term stable in a large phase-space of orbital parameters with an orbital configuration suggesting apsidal alignment, but not in any particular high-order mean-motion resonant commensurability. GJ 1148 b orbits inside the optimistic habitable zone (HZ). We find only a narrow stability region around the planet where exomoons can exist. However, in this stable region exomoons exhibit quick orbital decay due to tidal interaction with the planet. Conclusions. The GJ 1148 planetary system is a very rare M-dwarf planetary system consisting of a pair of gas giants, the inner of which resides in the HZ.

  abstract = {Context. The High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph has been mounted since 2003 at the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla and provides state-of-the-art stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to {$\sim$}1 m s-1. The spectra are extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS), and the RVs are computed by cross-correlating with a numerical mask. Aims. This study has three main aims: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply the new public SpEctrum Radial Velocity AnaLyser (SERVAL) pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV data set. (iii) Determine whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved by correcting for small nightly systematic effects. Methods. For each star observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. This was based on fitting each observed spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio template created by coadding all the available spectra of that star. We then computed nightly zero-points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars. Results. By analyzing the RVs of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is \textbackslash textless 5 m s-1, we find that SERVAL RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. By investigating the NZP time series, we find three significant systematic effects whose magnitude is independent of the software that is used to derive the RV: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of {$\sim$}1 m s-1; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of {$\sim$}1 m s-1 and a typical timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20-30 NZPs that significantly deviate by a few m s-1. In addition, we find small ({$\leq$} 1 m s-1) but significant intra-night drifts in DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump that strongly depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from {$\sim$}14 m s-1 for late F-type stars to {$\sim$} - 3 m s-1 for M dwarfs. The combined effect of extracting the RVs with SERVAL and correcting them for the systematics we find is an improved average RV precision: an improvement of {$\sim$}5\% for spectra taken before the 2015 intervention, and an improvement of {$\sim$}15\% for spectra taken after it. To demonstrate the quality of the new RV data set, we present an updated orbital solution of the GJ 253 two-planet system. Conclusions. Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be retrieved from a user-friendly public database. It provides more than 212 000 RVs for about 3000 stars along with much auxiliary information, such as the NZP corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.},

  abstract = {We present a sub-arcsecond resolution survey of the 340 GHz dust continuum emission from 50 nearby protoplanetary disks, based on new and archival observations with the Submillimeter Array. The observed visibility data were modeled with a simple prescription for the radial surface brightness profile. The results were used to extract intuitive, empirical estimates of the emission ``size'' for each disk, Reff, defined as the radius that encircles a fixed fraction of the total continuum luminosity, Lmm. We find a significant correlation between the sizes and luminosities, such that Reff {$\propto$} Lmm0.5 , providing a confirmation and quantitative characterization of a putative trend that was noted previously. This correlation suggests that these disks have roughly the same average surface brightness interior to their given effective radius, {$\sim$}0.2 Jy arcsec-2 (or 8 K in brightness temperature). The same trend remains, but the 0.2 dex of dispersion perpendicular to this relation essentially disappears, when we account for the irradiation environment of each disk with a crude approximation of the dust temperatures based on the stellar host luminosities. We consider two (not mutually exclusive) explanations for the origin of this size\textendash luminosity relationship. Simple models of the growth and migration of disk solids can account for the observed trend for a reasonable range of initial conditions, but only on timescales that are much shorter than the nominal ages present in the sample. An alternative scenario invokes optically thick emission concentrated on unresolved scales, with filling factors of a few tens of percent, that are perhaps manifestations of localized particle traps.},

  abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarised, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of {$\sim$}2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals. Our model reproduces all the important characteristics of the giant planets' orbits, namely their final semimajor axes, eccentricities and mutual inclinations.},

Furthermore, because of their low masses and luminosities, Doppler measurements enable the detection of low-mass planets in their habitable zones that correspond to closer orbits than for Solar-type stars. We re-analyse literature UVES radial velocities of 41 nearby M dwarfs in a combination with new velocities obtained from publicly available spectra from the HARPS-ESO spectrograph of these stars in an attempt to constrain any low-amplitude Keplerian signals. We apply Bayesian signal detection criteria, together with posterior sampling techniques, in combination with noise models that take into account correlations in the data and obtain estimates for the number of planet candidates in the sample. More generally, we use the estimated detection probability function to calculate the occurrence rate of low-mass planets around nearby M dwarfs. We report eight new planet candidates in the sample (orbiting GJ 27.1, GJ 160.2, GJ 180, GJ 229, GJ 422, and GJ 682), including two new multiplanet systems, and confirm two previously known candidates in the GJ 433 system based on detections of Keplerian signals in the combined UVES and HARPS radial velocity data that cannot be explained by periodic and/or quasiperiodic phenomena related to stellar activities. Finally, we use the estimated detection probability function to calculate the occurrence rate of low-mass planets around nearby M dwarfs. According to our results, M dwarfs are hosts to an abundance of low-mass planets and the occurrence rate of planets less massive than 10 M\$\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ is of the order of one planet per star, possibly even greater. ...},

Their abundancy implies that the general occurrence rate of planets is dominated by their occurrence rate around such M dwarfs. In this article, we combine the M dwarf surveys conducted with the HIRES/Keck, PFS/Magellan, HARPS/ESO, and UVES/VLT instruments supported with data from several other instruments. We analyse the radial velocities of an approximately volume- and brightness-limited sample of 426 nearby M dwarfs in order to search for Doppler signals of cadidate planets. In addition, we analyse spectroscopic activity indicators and ASAS photometry to rule out radial velocity signals corresponding to stellar activity as Doppler signals of planets. We calculate estimates for the occurrence rate of planets around the sample stars and study the properties of this occurrence rate as a function of stellar properties. Our analyses reveal a total of 118 candidate planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs. Based on our results accounting for selection effects and sample detection threshold, we estimate that M dwarfs have on average at least 2.39\$\^\{+4.58\}\_\{-1.36\}\$ planets per star orbiting them. Accounting for the different sensitivities of radial velocity surveys and Kepler transit photometry implies that there are at least 3.0 planets per star orbiting M dwarfs. We also present evidence for a population of cool mini-Neptunes and Neptunes with indications that they are found an order of magnitude more frequently orbiting the least massive M dwarfs in our sample.},

  abstract = {Population studies of the orbital characteristics of exoplanets in multi-planet systems highlighted the existence of an anti-correlation between the average orbital eccentricity of planets and the number of planets of their host system (i.e. its multiplicity). This effect was proposed to reflect the different violence of the dynamical evolution of the planetary systems. Previous work suggested that the relative violence of the dynamical evolution of planetary systems with similar orbital architectures can be compared through the computation of their angular momentum deficit (AMD). We investigated the possibility of using a more general metric to perform analogous comparisons between planetary systems with different orbital architectures. We considered a modified version of the AMD, the normalized angular momentum deficit (NAMD), and used it to study a sample of 99 multi-planet systems containing both the currently best-characterized extrasolar systems and the Solar System, i.e. planetary systems with both compact and wide orbital architectures. We verified that the NAMD allows to compare the violence of the dynamical histories of multi-planet systems with different orbital architectures. We identified an anti-correlation between the NAMD and the multiplicity of the planetary systems, of which the previously observed eccentricity\textendash multiplicity anti\textendash correlation is a reflection. Our results seem to indicate that phases of dynamical instabilities and chaotic evolution are not uncommon among planetary systems. They also suggest that the efficiency of the planetary formation process in producing high-multiplicity systems is likely higher that suggested by their currently known population.},

We observed a complete population of Class 0 and I protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud at 4.1 cm and 6.4 cm with resolution and sensitivity superior to previous surveys. From a total of 71 detections, 8 sources exhibit resolved emission at 4.1 cm and/or 6.4 cm. In this paper we focus on this sub-sample, analyzing their spectral indices along the jet, and their alignment with respect to the large-scale molecular outflow. Spectral indices for fluxes integrated toward the position of the protostar are consistent with free-free thermal emission. The value of the spectral index along a radio jet decreases with distance from the protostar. For six sources, emission is well aligned with the outflow central axis, showing that we observe the ionized base of the jet. This is not the case for two sources, where we note misalignment of the emission with respect to the large-scale outflow. This might indicate that the emission does not originate in the radio jet, but rather in an ionized outflow cavity wall or disk surface. For five of the sources, the spectral indices along the jet decrease well below the thermal free-free limit of -0.1 with \$\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ significance. This is indicative of synchrotron emission, meaning that high energy electrons are being produced in the outflows close to the disk. This result can have far-reaching implications for the chemical composition of the embedded disks.},

Therefore, measuring properties of protostars at radio frequencies can provide valuable insights into the nature of their outflows and jets. We present a C-band (4.1 and 6.4 cm) survey of all known protostars (Class 0 and Class I) in Perseus as part of the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) Survey. We examine the known correlations between radio flux density and protostellar parameters, such as bolometric luminosity and outflow force, for our sample. We also investigate the relationship between radio flux density and far-infrared line luminosities from Herschel. We show that free\textendash free emission most likely originates from J-type shocks; however, the large scatter indicates that those two types of emission probe different time and spatial scales. Using C-band fluxes, we removed an estimation of free\textendash free contamination from the corresponding Ka-band (9 mm) flux densities that primarily probe dust emission from embedded disks. We find that the compact (\textbackslash textless1{${''}$}) dust emission is lower for Class I sources (median dust mass 96 M {$\oplus$}) relative to Class 0 (248 M {$\oplus$}), but several times higher than in Class II (5\textendash 15 M {$\oplus$}). If this compact dust emission is tracing primarily the embedded disk, as is likely for many sources, this result provides evidence of decreasing disk masses with protostellar evolution, with sufficient mass for forming giant planet cores primarily at early times.},

  abstract = {In recent years evidence has been building that planet formation starts early, in the first \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$ 0.5 Myr. Studying the dust masses available in young disks enables understanding the origin of planetary systems since mature disks are lacking the solid material necessary to reproduce the observed exoplanetary systems, especially the massive ones. We aim to determine if disks in the embedded stage of star formation contain enough dust to explain the solid content of the most massive exoplanets. We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations of embedded disks in the Perseus star-forming region together with Very Large Array (VLA) Ka-band (9 mm) data to provide a robust estimate of dust disk masses from the flux densities. Using the DIANA opacity model including large grains, with a dust opacity value of \$\textbackslash backslashkappa\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm 9\textbackslash backslash mm\}\$ = 0.28 cm\$\^\{2\}\$ g\$\^\{-1\}\$, the median dust masses of the embedded disks in Perseus are 158 M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ for Class 0 and 52 M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ for Class I from the VLA fluxes. The lower limits on the median masses from ALMA fluxes are 47 M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ and 12 M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ for Class 0 and Class I, respectively, obtained using the maximum dust opacity value \$\textbackslash backslashkappa\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm 1.3mm\}\$ = 2.3 cm\$\^\{2\}\$ g\$\^\{-1\}\$. The dust masses of young Class 0 and I disks are larger by at least a factor of 10 and 3, respectively, compared with dust masses inferred for Class II disks in Lupus and other regions. The dust masses of Class 0 and I disks in Perseus derived from the VLA data are high enough to produce the observed exoplanet systems with efficiencies acceptable by planet formation models: the solid content in observed giant exoplanets can be explained if planet formation starts in Class 0 phase with an efficiency of \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$ 15\%. Higher efficiency of \$\textbackslash backslashsim\$ 30\% is necessary if the planet formation is set to start in Class I disks.},

OGLE-2017-BLG-1434Lb is the eighth microlensing planet with planet-host mass ratio q \textbackslash textless 1 * 10\^-4. We apply a new planet-detection sensitivity method, which is a variant of "V/V\_max", to seven of these eight planets to derive the mass-ratio function in this regime. We find dN/d(ln q) {$\sim$} q\^p, with p = 1.05 (+0.78,-0.68), which confirms the "turnover" in the mass function found by Suzuki et al. relative to the power law of opposite sign n = -0.93 +/- 0.13 at higher mass ratios q \textbackslash textgreater{$\sim$} 2 * 10\^-4. We combine our result with that of Suzuki et al. to obtain p = 0.73 (+0.42,-0.34).},

  abstract = {Mass and radius are two fundamental properties for characterising exoplanets, but only for a relatively small fraction of exoplanets are they both available. Mass is often derived from radial velocity measurements, while the radius is almost always measured using the transit method. For a large number of exoplanets, either the radius or the mass is unknown, while the host star has been characterised. Several mass-radius relations that are dependent on the planet's type have been published that often allow us to predict the radius. Our goal is to derive the radius of exoplanets using only observables extracted from spectra used primarily to determine radial velocities and spectral parameters. Our objective is to obtain a mass-radius relation independent of the planet's type. We worked with a database of confirmed exoplanets with known radii and masses, as well as the planets from our Solar System. Using random forests, a machine learning algorithm, we computed the radius of exoplanets and compared the results to the published radii. Our code, Bem, is available online. The estimated radii reproduces the spread in radius found for high mass planets better than previous mass-radius relations. The average radius error is 1.8 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ across the whole range of radii from 1-22 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$. We find that a random forest algorithm is able to derive reliable radii, especially for planets between 4 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ and 20 \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashoplus\}\$ for which the error is under 25\$\textbackslash backslash\%\$. The algorithm has a low bias yet a high variance, which could be reduced by limiting the growth of the forest, or adding more data. The random forest algorithm is a promising method for deriving exoplanet properties. We show that the exoplanet's mass and equilibrium temperature are the relevant properties that constrain the radius, and do so with higher accuracy than the previous methods.},

  abstract = {After publication of our initial mass-radius-composition models for the TRAPPIST-1 system in Unterborn et al. (2018), the planet masses were updated in Grimm et al. (2018). We had originally adopted the data set of Wang et al., 2017 who reported different densities than the updated values. The differences in observed density change the inferred volatile content of the planets. Grimm et al. (2018) report TRAPPIST-1 b, d, f, g, and h as being consistent with \textbackslash textless5 wt\% water and TRAPPIST-1 c and e has having largely rocky interiors. Here, we present updated results recalculating water fractions and potential alternative compositions using the Grimm et al., 2018 masses. Overall, we can only reproduce the results of Grimm et al., 2018 of planets b, d and g having small water contents if the cores of these planets are small (\textbackslash textless23 wt\%). We show that, if the cores for these planets are roughly Earth-sized (33 wt\%), significant water fractions up to 40 wt\% are possible. We show planets c, e, f, and h can have volatile envelopes between 0-35 wt\% that are also consistent with being totally oxidized and lacking an Fe-core entirely. We note here that a pure MgSiO\$\_3\$ planet (Fe/Mg = 0) is not the true lowest density end-member mass-radius curve for determining the probability of a planet containing volatiles. All planets that are rocky likely contain some Fe, either within the core or oxidized in the mantle. We argue the true low density end-member for oxidizing systems is instead a planet with the lowest reasonable Fe/Mg and completely core-less. Using this logic, we assert that planets b, d and g likely must have significant volatile layers because the end-member planet models produce masses too high even when uncertainties in both mass and radius are taken into account.},

  abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 system, containing 7 transiting planets with constrained masses and radii, offers a singular opportunity to understand planet formation in another system. Not only can individual planets' bulk compositions be inferred, variations in composition (with respect to distance from the star) probe the composition of the TRAPPIST-1 disk and test models of planet formation. Other studies have shown that many of the TRAPPIST-1 planets are lower in density than rock and must either possess thick atmospheres or substantial liquid water/ice. The small masses of the planets argue against atmospheres. We use our ExoPlex mass-radius software package to constrain the fraction of each planet mass that is water. While we concur that planets f and g contain substantial (\$\textbackslash textgreater 50\$wt\%) water/ice, we find b must be \$\textbackslash backslashgeq 6-8\$wt\% water, but c must be \$\textbackslash backslashleq 6-8\$wt\% water. Since volatile fraction should increase with distance, the simplest interpretation is that both b and c each contain \$\textbackslash backslashapprox 7\$wt\% water. Planets formed outside the snow line of TRAPPIST-1's disk are expected to contain \$\textbackslash backslashsim 50\$wt\% water ice like f and g, but the much lower ice abundances of b and c imply they formed inside the snow line. The TRAPPIST-1 system is marked by multiple mean motion resonances; for this and other reasons, substantial inward migration of the planets to their present orbits is inferred. We calculate the location of the snow line in the TRAPPIST-1 disk as a function of time. Depending on how rapidly the planets formed, the TRAPPIST-1 planets are at 1/2 to 1/8 of their starting distances from the star. While we infer that b and c formed inside the snow line, they contain much more water than planets formed inside the snow line in the Solar System (Earth is \$\textbackslash textless 0.1\$wt\% water), implying that the volatile gradient in TRAPPIST-1 was more gradual than in the Solar System.},

  abstract = {Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside the Solar System1, most of which orbit stars that will eventually evolve into red giants and then into white dwarfs. During the red giant phase, any close-orbiting planets will be engulfed by the star2, but more distant planets can survive this phase and remain in orbit around the white dwarf3,4. Some white dwarfs show evidence for rocky material floating in their atmospheres5, in warm debris disks6\textendash 9 or orbiting very closely10\textendash 12, which has been interpreted as the debris of rocky planets that were scattered inwards and tidally disrupted13. Recently, the discovery of a gaseous debris disk with a composition similar to that of ice giant planets14 demonstrated that massive planets might also find their way into tight orbits around white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether these planets can survive the journey. So far, no intact planets have been detected in close orbits around white dwarfs. Here we report the observation of a giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4 days. We observed and modelled the periodic dimming of the white dwarf caused by the planet candidate passing in front of the star in its orbit. The planet candidate is roughly the same size as Jupiter and is no more than 14 times as massive (with 95 per cent confidence). Other cases of white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence of common-envelope evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during the red giant phase and shrinks owing to friction. In this case, however, the long orbital period (compared with other white dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions) and low mass of the planet candidate make common-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, our findings for the WD 1856+534 system indicate that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being tidally disrupted, motivating the search for smaller transiting planets around white dwarfs.},

  abstract = {This thesis discusses the structure of gas and dust in protoplanetary disks around young stars, in which the planets are formed, using ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) observations. Primary targets of this study are the so-called 'transition disks', with a central cavity in the dust disk. A possible explanation for the presence of this cavity is the recent formation of a young planet which has cleared its own orbit. ALMA can for the first time zoom in onto the structure of both gas and dust and answer this question. The thesis presents the first ALMA observations of cold molecular gas and dust in transition disks. These data show that millimeter-dust grains are concentrated in a 'dust trap', allowing the dust particles to grow to larger sizes, an important step in the planet formation process. Also, it turns out that gas is still present in the dust cavity of the disks in this study, its structure points indeed towards the planet clearing mechanism. These discoveries form a giant leap in our understanding of planet formation. In the coming years, ALMA will be completed and allow us to see even smaller details in these disks, possibly even the planets itself.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks with large inner dust cavities are thought to host massive planetary or substellar companions. These disks show asymmetries and rings in the millimeter continuum, caused by dust trapping in pressure bumps, and potentially vortices or horseshoes. The origin of the asymmetries and their diversity remains unclear. We present a comprehensive study of 16 disks for which the gas surface density profile has been constrained by CO isotopologue data. We compare the azimuthal extents of the dust continuum profiles with the local gas surface density in each disk, and find that the asymmetries correspond to higher Stokes numbers or low gas surface density. We discuss which asymmetric structures can be explained by a horseshoe, a vortex or spiral density waves. Second, we reassess the gas gap radii from the \$\^\{13\}\$CO maps, which are about a factor 2 smaller than the dust ring radii, suggesting that companions in these disks are in the brown dwarf mass regime (\$\textbackslash backslashsim 15-50 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Jup\}\$) or in the Super-Jovian mass regime (\$\textbackslash backslashsim 3-15 M\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Jup\}\$) on eccentric orbits. This is consistent with the estimates from contrast curves on companion mass limits. These curves rule out (sub)stellar companions (\$q\textbackslash textgreater\$0.05) for the majority of the sample at the gap location, but it remains possible at even smaller radii. Third, we find that spiral arms in scattered light images are primarily detected around high luminosity stars with disks with wide gaps, which can be understood by the dependence of the spiral arm pitch angle on disk temperature and companion mass.},

We present a large sample study of ALMA disk surveys of nearby star-forming regions to disentangle this connection. All disks are classified as either structured (transition, ring, extended) or non-structured (compact) disks. Although low-resolution observations may not identify large scale substructure, we assume that an extended disk must contain substructure from a dust evolution argument. A comparison across ages reveals that structured disks retain high dust masses up to at least 10 Myr, whereas the dust mass of compact, non-structured disks decreases over time. This can be understood if the dust mass evolves primarily by radial drift, unless drift is prevented by pressure bumps. We identify a stellar mass dependence of the fraction of structured disks. We propose a scenario linking this dependence with that of giant exoplanet occurrence rates. We show that there are enough exoplanets to account for the observed disk structures if transitional disks are created by exoplanets more massive than Jupiter, and ring disks by exoplanets more massive than Neptune, under the assumption that most of those planets eventually migrate inwards. On the other hand, the known anti-correlation between transiting super-Earths and stellar mass implies those planets must form in the disks without observed structure, consistent with formation through pebble accretion in drift-dominated disks.

It is aimed at new researchers in the field to enable them to obtain a quick overview of the landscape and key literature in this rapidly evolving area. The journey of molecules from clouds to protostellar envelopes, disks and ultimately exoplanet atmospheres is described. The importance of the close relation between the chemistry of gas and ice and the physical structure and evolution of planet-forming disks, including the growth and drift of grains and the locking up of elements at dust traps, is stressed. Using elemental abundance ratios like C/O, C/N, O/H in exoplanetary atmospheres to link them to their formation sites is therefore not straightforward. Interesting clues come from meteorites and comets in our own solar system, as well as from the composition of Earth. A new frontier is the analysis of the kinematics of molecular lines to detect young planets in disks. A number of major questions to be addressed in the coming years are formulated, and challenges and opportunities are highlighted.},

Here, we investigate the presence, location, and shape of such a valley using a small samplewith highly accurate stellar parameters determined from asteroseismology,which includes 117 planets with a median uncertainty on the radius of 3.3 per cent.We detect a clear bimodal distribution, with super-Earths ({$\approx$}1.5R{$\oplus$}) and sub-Neptunes ({$\approx$}2.5R{$\oplus$}) separated by a deficiency around 2R{$\oplus$}. We furthermore characterize the slope of the valley as a power law R{$\alpha$}P{$\gamma$} with {$\gamma$} = -0.09+0.02 -0.04. A negative slope is consistent with models of photoevaporation, but not with the late formation of rocky planets in a gas-poor environment, which would lead to a slope of opposite sign. The exact location of the gap further points to planet cores consisting of a significant fraction of rocky material.},

From these observations, we find the masses of the planets to be \$1.58 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.26\$, \$6.14 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.38\$, and \$4.78 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.46\$ M\$\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$, respectively. The combination of radius and mass measurements suggests that the innermost planet has a rocky composition similar to that of Earth, while the outer two planets have lower densities. Thus, the inner planet and the outer planets are on opposite sides of the `radius valley' \textendash{} a region in the radius-period diagram with relatively few members, which has been interpreted as a consequence of atmospheric photo-evaporation. We place these findings into the context of other small close-in planets orbiting M dwarf stars, and use support vector machines to determine the location and slope of the M dwarf (\$T\_\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{eff\} \textbackslash textless 4000\$ K) radius valley as a function of orbital period. We compare the location of the M dwarf radius valley to the radius valley observed for FGK stars, and find that its location is a good match to photo-evaporation and core-powered mass loss models. Finally, we show that planets below the M dwarf radius valley have compositions consistent with stripped rocky cores, whereas most planets above have a lower density consistent with the presence of a H-He atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The existence of a radius valley in the Kepler size distribution stands as one of the most important observational constraints to understand the origin and composition of exoplanets with radii between those of Earth and Neptune. In this work we provide insights into the existence of the radius valley, first from a pure formation point of view and then from a combined formation-evolution model. We run global planet formation simulations including the evolution of dust by coagulation, drift, and fragmentation, and the evolution of the gaseous disc by viscous accretion and photoevaporation. A planet grows from a moon-mass embryo by either silicate or icy pebble accretion, depending on its position with respect to the water ice line. We include gas accretion, type I\textendash II migration, and photoevaporation driven mass-loss after formation. We perform an extensive parameter study evaluating a wide range of disc properties and initial locations of the embryo. We find that due to the change in dust properties at the water ice line, rocky cores form typically with {$\sim$}3 M {$\oplus$} and have a maximum mass of {$\sim$}5 M {$\oplus$} , while icy cores peak at {$\sim$}10 M {$\oplus$} , with masses lower than 5 M {$\oplus$} being scarce. When neglecting the gaseous envelope, the formed rocky and icy cores account naturally for the two peaks of the Kepler size distribution. The presence of massive envelopes yields planets more massive than {$\sim$}10 M {$\oplus$} with radii above 4 R {$\oplus$} . While the first peak of the Kepler size distribution is undoubtedly populated by bare rocky cores, as shown extensively in the past, the second peak can host half-rock\textendash half-water planets with thin or non-existent H-He atmospheres, as suggested by a few previous studies. Some additional mechanisms inhibiting gas accretion or promoting envelope mass-loss should operate at short orbital periods to explain the presence of {$\sim$}10\textendash 40 M {$\oplus$} planets falling in the second peak of the size distribution.},

  abstract = {Observations of structure in circumstellar debris discs provide circumstantial evidence for the presence of massive planets at large (several tens of astronomical units) orbital radii, where the time-scale for planet formation via core accretion is prohibitively long. Here, we investigate whether a population of distant planets can be produced via outward migration subsequent to formation in the inner disc. Two possibilities for significant outward migration are identified. First, cores that form early at radii a {$\sim$} 10 au can be carried to larger radii via gravitational interaction with the gaseous disc. This process is efficient if there is strong mass loss from the disc - either within a cluster or due to photoevaporation from a star more massive than the Sun - but does not require the extremely destructive environment found, for example, in the core of the Orion nebula. We find that, depending upon the disc model, gas disc migration can yield massive planets (several Jupiter masses) at radii of around 20-50 au. Secondly, interactions within multiple planet systems can drive the outer planet into a large, normally highly eccentric orbit. A series of scattering experiments suggests that this process is most efficient for lower-mass planets within systems of unequal mass ratio. This mechanism is a good candidate for explaining the origin of relatively low-mass giant planets in eccentric orbits at large radii.},

  abstract = {The SHINE project is a 500-star survey performed with SPHERE on the VLT for the purpose of directly detecting new substellar companions and understanding their formation and early evolution. Here we present an initial statistical analysis for a subsample of 150 stars that are representative of the full SHINE sample. Our goal is to constrain the frequency of substellar companions with masses between 1 and 75 MJup and semimajor axes between 5 and 300 au. We adopt detection limits as a function of angular separation from the survey data for all stars converted into mass and projected orbital separation using the BEX-COND-hot evolutionary tracks and known distance to each system. Based on the results obtained for each star and on the 13 detections in the sample, we use a MCMC tool to compare our observations to two different types of models. The first is a parametric model based on observational constraints, and the second type are numerical models that combine advanced core accretion and gravitational instability planet population synthesis. Using the parametric model, we show that the frequencies of systems with at least one substellar companion are \$23.0\_\{-9.7\}\^\{+13.5\}\textbackslash backslash\%\$, \$5.8\_\{-2.8\}\^\{+4.7\}\textbackslash backslash\%\$, and \$12.6\_\{-7.1\}\^\{+12.9\}\textbackslash backslash\%\$ for BA, FGK, and M stars, respectively. We also demonstrate that a planet-like formation pathway probably dominates the mass range from 1-75 MJup for companions around BA stars, while for M dwarfs, brown dwarf binaries dominate detections. In contrast, a combination of binary star-like and planet-like formation is required to best fit the observations for FGK stars. Using our population model and restricting our sample to FGK stars, we derive a frequency of \$5.7\_\{-2.8\}\^\{+3.8\}\textbackslash backslash\%\$, consistent with predictions from the parametric model. More generally, the frequency values that we derive are in excellent agreement with values obtained in previous studies.},

While most studies assume planetary cores as an initial condition in their simulation, the question how, where and when these cores form is often neglected. Aims. We study the impact of pebble accretion during the formation phase and subsequent evolution of planetary embryos in the early stages of circumstellar disk evolution. In doing so we aim to quantify the timescales and local dependency of planetary embryo formation, based on the solid evolution of the disk. Methods. We connect a one dimensional two population model for solid evolution and pebble flux regulated planetesimal formation to the N-body code LIPAD. In our study we focus on the growth of planetesimals with an initial size of 100km in diameter by planetesimal collisions and pebble accretion for the first 1 million years of a viscously evolving disk. We compare 18 different N- body simulations in which we vary the total planetesimal mass after 1 million years, the surface density profile of the planetesimal disk, the radial pebble flux and the possibility of pebble accretion. Results. Pebble accretion leads to the formation of fewer, but substantially more massive embryos. The area of possible embryo formation is weakly influenced by the accretion of pebbles and the innermost embryos tend to form slightly earlier compared to the simulations in which pebble accretion is neglected. Conclusions. Pebble accretion strongly enhances the formation of super earths in the terrestrial planet region, but it does not enhance the formation of embryos at larger distances.},

  abstract = {Context. The growth-timescales of planetary embryos and their formation process are imperative for our understanding on how planetary systems form and develop. They determine the subsequent growth mechanisms during the life stages of a circumstellar disk. Aims. We quantify the timescales and spatial distribution of planetary embryos through collisional growth and fragmentation of dynamically forming 100 km sized planetesimals. In our study, the formation timescales of viscous disk evolution and planetesimal formation are linked to the formation of planetary embryos in the terrestrial planet zone. Methods. We connected a one-dimensional model for viscous gas evolution, dust and pebble dynamics, and pebble flux-regulated planetesimal formation to the N -body code LIPAD. Our framework enabled us to study the formation, growth, fragmentation, and evolution of planetesimals with an initial size of 100 km in diameter for the first million years of a viscous disk. Results. Our study shows the effect of the planetesimal surface density evolution on the preferential location and timescales of planetary embryo formation. Only the innermost embryos (\textbackslash textless2 au) in our study form well within the lifetime of an active pebble flux for any disk studied. Higher planetesimal disk masses and steeper planetesimal surface density profiles result in more massive embryos within a larger area, rather than in a higher number of embryos. A one-dimensional analytically derived model for embryo formation based on the local planetesimal surface density evolution is presented. This model can reproduce the spatial distribution, formation rate, and total number of planetary embryos at a fraction of the computational cost of the N -body simulations. Conclusions. The formation of planetary embryos in the terrestrial planet zone occurs simultaneously with the formation of planetesimals. The local planetesimal surface density evolution and the orbital spacing of planetary embryos in the oligarchic regime are good constraints for modeling planetary embryo formation analytically. Our embryo formation model is a valuable asset in future studies of planet formation.},

The observation of N dark rings of emission is often interpreted as evidence for the presence of N planets which clear dust gaps around their orbit and form dust-trapping pressure maxima in the disk. The vast majority of the models that studied the impact of planets on the dynamics of dust and gas in a protoplanetary disk assumed planets on fixed orbits. Here we go a different route and examine how the large-scale inward migration of a single planet structures the dust content of a massive disk. In many circumstances, the migration of a partial gap-opening planet with a mass comparable to Saturn is found to run away intermittently. By means of 2D gas and dust hydrodynamical simulations, we show that intermittent runaway migration can form multiple dust rings and gaps across the disk. Each time migration slows down, a pressure maximum forms beyond the planet gap that traps the large dust. Post-processing of our simulations results with 3D dust radiative transfer calculations confirms that intermittent runaway migration can lead to the formation of multiple sets of bright and dark rings of continuum emission in the (sub)millimeter beyond the planet location.},

  abstract = {A major outstanding question regarding the formation of planetary systems is whether wide-orbit giant planets form differently than close-in giant planets. We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: 1) the relative mass function and 2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions, and the detection limits on lower-mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that 1) the companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a functional form of \$N\textbackslash backslashpropto M\^\{-1.3\textbackslash backslashpm0.3\}\$, and consequently, 2) many of these systems likely host additional undetected sub-stellar companions. Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets.},

  abstract = {Jupiter and Saturn formed in a few million years (ref. 1) from a gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration of their orbits on timescales of only {$\sim$}100,000 years (ref. 2). Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration. The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later, and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (1au is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5au, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1au; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3au and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought. \textcopyright{} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Context. Near- to mid-infrared observations of molecular emission from protoplanetary disks show that the inner regions are rich in small organic volatiles (e.g., C2H2 and HCN). Trends in the data suggest that disks around cooler stars (Teff 3000 K) are potentially (i) more carbon-rich; and (ii) more molecule-rich than their hotter counterparts (Teff {$\leq$} 4000 K). Aims. We explore the chemical composition of the planet-forming region (\textbackslash textless10 AU) of protoplanetary disks around stars over a range of spectral types (from M dwarf to Herbig Ae) and compare with the observed trends. Methods. Self-consistent models of the physical structure of a protoplanetary disk around stars of different spectral types are coupled with a comprehensive gas-grain chemical network to map the molecular abundances in the planet-forming zone. The effects of (i) N2 self shielding; (ii) X-ray-induced chemistry; and (iii) initial abundances, are investigated. The chemical composition in the "observable" atmosphere is compared with that in the disk midplane where the bulk of the planet-building reservoir resides. Results. M dwarf disk atmospheres are relatively more molecule rich than those for T Tauri or Herbig Ae disks. The weak far-UV flux helps retain this complexity which is enhanced by X-ray-induced ion-molecule chemistry. N2 self shielding has only a small effect in the disk molecular layer and does not explain the higher C2H2/HCN ratios observed towards cooler stars. The models underproduce the OH/H2O column density ratios constrained in Herbig Ae disks, despite reproducing (within an order of magnitude) the absolute value for OH: the inclusion of self shielding for H2O photodissociation only increases this discrepancy. One possible explanation is the adopted disk structure. Alternatively, the "hot" H2O (T 300 K) chemistry may be more complex than assumed. The results for the atmosphere are independent of the assumed initial abundances; however, the composition of the disk midplane is sensitive to the initial main elemental reservoirs. The models show that the gas in the inner disk is generally more carbon rich than the midplane ices. This effect is most significant for disks around cooler stars. Furthermore, the atmospheric C/O ratio appears larger than it actually is when calculated using observable tracers only. This is because gas-phase O2 is predicted to be a significant reservoir of atmospheric oxygen. Conclusions. The models suggest that the gas in the inner regions of disks around cooler stars is more carbon rich; however, calculations of the molecular emission are necessary to definitively confirm whether the chemical trends reproduce the observed trends.},

The SED of PDS 70 c is less well constrained, with a range of total luminosities spanning an order of magnitude. With our inferred radii and luminosities, we used evolutionary models of accreting protoplanets to derive a mass of PDS 70 b between 2 and 4 \$M\_\{\textbackslash backslashtextrm\{Jup\}\}\$ and a mean mass accretion rate between \$3 \textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^\{-7\}\$ and \$8 \textbackslash backslashtimes 10\^\{-7\}{$\sim$}M\_\{\textbackslash backslashtextrm\{Jup\}\}/\textbackslash backslashtextrm\{yr\}\$.

We obtained K-band spectra and 100 \$\textbackslash backslashmu\$as precision astrometry of both PDS 70 b and c in two epochs, as well as spatially resolving the hot inner disk around the star. Rejecting unstable orbits, we found a nonzero eccentricity for PDS 70 b of \$0.17 \textbackslash backslashpm 0.06\$, a near-circular orbit for PDS 70 c, and an orbital configuration that is consistent with the planets migrating into a 2:1 mean motion resonance. Enforcing dynamical stability, we obtained a 95\% upper limit on the mass of PDS 70 b of 10 \$M\_\textbackslash backslashtextrm\{Jup\}\$, while the mass of PDS 70 c was unconstrained. The GRAVITY K-band spectra rules out pure blackbody models for the photospheres of both planets. Instead, the models with the most support from the data are planetary atmospheres that are dusty, but the nature of the dust is unclear. Any circumplanetary dust around these planets is not well constrained by the planets' 1-5 \$\textbackslash backslashmu\$m spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and requires longer wavelength data to probe with SED analysis. However with VLTI/GRAVITY, we made the first observations of a circumplanetary environment with sub-au spatial resolution, placing an upper limit of 0.3{$\sim$}au on the size of a bright disk around PDS 70 b.},

  abstract = {The tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a circumstellar gaseous disk results in mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the secondary. There are two, conceptually distinct circumstances wherein nebula torques can cause a secular variation in a protoplanet's semimajor axis. (I) The net torque exerted on a secondary by an undisturbed disk is not, in general, zero. Although gradients in the disk density and temperature can contribute to this torque, it is mostly due to asymmetries in the disk/planet interaction that are inherent to a Keplerian disk. For a relatively thick disk, the differential torque can be a significant fraction of the torque from either its exterior or its interior portion. In this case, the protoplanet drifts relative to disk material on a time scale inversely proportional to its mass. (II) The protoplanet opens a gap in the disk that establishes a flow barrier to disk material. A density discontinuity that locks the protoplanet into the disk's viscous evolution develops across the orbit. The protoplanet migrates on a time scale set by the disk's viscosity. A unified model that clarifies the relationship between these migration types and reveals under what circumstances a given type is selected is presented. In both cases, orbital decay is the prevailing outcome, although type I migration rates can be between one and two orders of magnitudes faster than type II. Estimates of orbital lifetimes are given and are generally shorter than the expected lifetime of the disk. Some implications to the issue of planetary formation are discussed. \textcopyright{} 1997 Academic Press.},

HAT-P-23b's relatively high surface gravity (g {$\sim$} 30 m/s\^2), combined with updated stellar and planetary parameters from Gaia DR2, gives a 5-scale-height signal of 384 ppm for a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Bayesian models favor a clear atmosphere for the planet with the tentative presence of TiO, after simultaneously modeling stellar contamination, using spots parameter constraints from photometry. If confirmed, HAT-P-23b would be the first example of a high-gravity gas giant with a clear atmosphere observed in transmission at optical/NIR wavelengths; therefore, we recommend expanding observations to the UV and IR to confirm our results and further characterize this planet. This result demonstrates how combining transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres with long-term photometric monitoring of the host stars can help disentangle the exoplanet and stellar activity signals.},

The survival of Vesta's basaltic crust also implies that the early SFD had a shallow slope in the range {$\sim$}10-100 km. (Morbidelli, A., Bottke, W.F., Nesvorny, D., Levison, H.F. [2009]. Icarus 204, 558-573) were unable to produce these features by accretion from an initial population of km-sized planetesimals. They concluded that bodies with sizes in the range {$\sim$}100-1000 km and a SFD similar to the current population were produced directly from solid particles of sub-meter scale, without experiencing accretion through intermediate sizes. We present results of new accretion simulations in the primordial asteroid region. The requisite SFD can be produced from an initial population of planetesimals of sizes {$\lessequivlnt$}0.1. km, smaller than the usual assumption of km-sized bodies. The bump at D{$\sim$}. 100 km is produced by a transition from dispersion-dominated runaway growth to a regime dominated by Keplerian shear, before the formation of large protoplanetary embryos. Thus, accretion of the asteroids from an initial population of small (sub-km) planetesimals cannot be ruled out. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We compared the stellar and planetary properties of the multis and singles in a homogenous subset of the full CKS-Gaia catalog. We found that sub-Neptune sized singles and multis do not differ in their stellar properties or planet radii. In particular: (1.) The distributions of stellar properties \$M\_\textbackslash backslashstar\$, [Fe/H], and \$v\textbackslash backslashmathrm\{sin\}i\$ for the Kepler sub Neptune-sized singles and multis are statistically indistinguishable. (2.) The radius distributions of the sub-Neptune sized singles and multis with \$P \textbackslash textgreater 3\$ days are indistinguishable, and both have a valley at \$\textbackslash backslashsim1.8{$\sim$}R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$. However, there are significantly more detected short-period (\$P \textbackslash textless 3\$ days), sub-Neptune sized singles than multis. The similarity of the host star properties, planet radii, and radius valley for singles and multis suggests a common origin. The similar radius valley, which is likely sculpted by photo-evaporation from the host star within the first 100 Myr, suggests that planets in both singles and multis spend much of the first 100 Myr near their present, close-in locations. One explanation that is consistent with the similar fundamental properties of singles and multis is that many of the singles are members of multi-planet systems that underwent planet-planet scattering.},

  abstract = {We propose a pebble-driven planet formation scenario to form giant planets with high multiplicity and large orbital distances in the early gas disk phase. We perform N-body simulations to investigate the growth and migration of low-mass protoplanets in the disk with inner viscously heated and outer stellar irradiated regions. The key feature of this model is that the giant planet cores grow rapidly by a combination of pebble accretion and planet-planet collisions. This consequently speeds up their gas accretion. Because of efficient growth, the planet transitions from rapid type I migration to slow type II migration early, reducing the inward migration substantially. Multiple giant planets can sequentially form in this way with increasing semimajor axes. Both mass growth and orbital retention are more pronounced when a large number of protoplanets are taken into account compared to the case of single planet growth. Eventually, a few numbers of giant planets form with orbital distances of a few to a few tens of AUs within 1.5-3 Myr after the birth of the protoplanets. The resulting simulated planet populations could be linked to the substructures exhibited in disk observations as well as large orbital distance exoplanets observed in radial velocity and microlensing surveys.},

The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets.

  abstract = {The stellar birth environment can significantly shorten protoplanetary disc (PPD) lifetimes due to the influence of stellar feedback mechanisms. The degree to which these mechanisms suppress the time and mass available for planet formation is dependent on the local far-ultraviolet (FUV) field strength, stellar density, and ISM properties. In this work, we present the first theoretical framework quantifying the distribution of PPD dispersal time-scales as a function of parameters that describe the galactic environment. We calculate the probability density function for FUV flux and stellar density in the solar neighbourhood. In agreement with previous studies, we find that external photoevaporation is the dominant environment-related factor influencing local stellar populations after the embedded phase. Applying our general prescription to the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way (i.e. the central {$\sim$} 250 pc), we predict that 90 per cent of PPDs in the region are destroyed within 1 Myr of the dispersal of the parent molecular cloud. Even in such dense environments, we find that external photoevaporation is the dominant disc depletion mechanism over dynamical encounters between stars. PPDs around low-mass stars are particularly sensitive to FUV-induced mass-loss, due to a shallower gravitational potential. For stars of mass {$\sim$}1 M{$\Sun$}, the solar neighbourhood lies at approximately the highest gas surface density for which PPD dispersal is still relatively unaffected by external FUV photons, with a median PPD dispersal time-scale of {$\sim$}4 Myr. We highlight the key questions to be addressed to further contextualize the significance of the local galactic environment for planet formation.},

  abstract = {Planet formation is generally described in terms of a system containing the host star and a protoplanetary disk1\textendash 3, of which the internal properties (for example, mass and metallicity) determine the properties of the resulting planetary system4. However, (proto)planetary systems are predicted5,6 and observed7,8 to be affected by the spatially clustered stellar formation environment, through either dynamical star\textendash star interactions or external photoevaporation by nearby massive stars9. It is challenging to quantify how the architecture of planetary sysems is affected by these environmental processes, because stellar groups spatially disperse within less than a billion years10, well below the ages of most known exoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet host stars in the astrometric data from the Gaia satellite11,12 and demonstrate that the architecture of planetary systems exhibits a strong dependence on local stellar clustering in position-velocity phase space. After controlling for host stellar age, mass, metallicity and distance from the star, we obtain highly significant differences (with p values of 10-5 to 10-2) in planetary system properties between phase space overdensities (composed of a greater number of co-moving stars than unstructured space) and the field. The median semi-major axis and orbital period of planets in phase space overdensities are 0.087 astronomical units and 9.6 days, respectively, compared to 0.81 astronomical units and 154 days, respectively, for planets around field stars. `Hot Jupiters' (massive, short-period exoplanets) predominantly exist in stellar phase space overdensities, strongly suggesting that their extreme orbits originate from environmental perturbations rather than internal migration13,14 or planet\textendash planet scattering15,16. Our findings reveal that stellar clustering is a key factor setting the architectures of planetary systems.},

As part of this sample, we present new VRI photometry for 17 targets, measured as a result of the RECONS group's long-term work at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m telescope. We also note the details of targets that are known to be members of multiple systems and find a preliminary multiplicity rate of 21 +/- 2\% for the primary M dwarfs in our sample, when considering known stellar and brown dwarf companions at all separations from their primaries. We further find that 43 +/- 2\% of all M dwarfs with masses 0.1 \textbackslash textless= M/M\_sol \textbackslash textless= 0.3 are found in multiple systems with primary stars of all masses within 15 pc.},

On the basis of such surveys, one might consider our planetary system highly unusual - but the reality is that we are only now beginning to uncover the true picture. In this work, we use the full eighteen-year archive of data from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search to examine the abundance of 'Cool Jupiters' - analogs to the Solar system's giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn. We find that such planets are intrinsically far more common through the cosmos than their siblings, the hot Jupiters. We find that the occurrence rate of such 'Cool Jupiters' is \$6.73\^\{+2.09\}\_\{-1.13\}\$\$\textbackslash backslash\$\%, almost an order of magnitude higher than the occurrence of hot Jupiters (at \$0.84\^\{+0.70\}\_\{-0.20\}\$\$\textbackslash backslash\$\%).

Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M{$\oplus$} and 3.4 M{$\oplus$} where M{$\oplus$} is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby ({$\sim$}500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829-10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies. \textcopyright{} 1992 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Recent high precision meteoritic data improve constraints on the formation timescale and bulk composition of the terrestrial planets. High resolution N-body simulations allow direct comparison of embryo growth timescale and accretion zones to these constraints. In this paper, we present results of high resolution simulations for embryo formation from a disc of up to 41,000 fully-self gravitating planetesimals with the GPU-based N-body code GENGA. Our results indicate that the growth of embryos are highly dependent on the initial conditions. More massive initial planetesimals, a shorter gas disc decay timescale and initially eccentric Jupiter and Saturn (EJS) all lead to faster growth of embryos. Asteroid belt material can thereby be implanted into the terrestrial planet region via sweeping secular resonances. This could possibly explain the rapid growth of Mars within 10 Myr inferred from its Hf-W chronology. The sweeping secular resonance almost completely clears the asteroid belt and deposits this material in the Mercury-Venus region, altering the composition of embryos there. This could result in embryos in the Mercury-Venus region accreting an unexpectedly high mass fraction from beyond 2 AU. Changing the initial orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to more circular (CJS) or assuming embryos formed in a gas free environment removes the sweeping secular resonance effect and thus greatly decreases material accreted from beyond 2 AU for Mercury-Venus region embryos. We therefore propose that rock samples from Mercury and Venus could aid greatly in deducing the condition and lifetime of the initial protoplanetary gas disc during planetesimal and embryo formation, as well as the initial architecture of the giant planets.},

  abstract = {The majority of the transiting planets discovered by the Kepler mission (called super-Earths here, includes the so-called 'sub-Neptunes') orbit close to their stars. As such, photoevaporation of their hydrogen envelopes etch sharp features in an otherwise bland space spanned by planet radius and orbital period. This, in turn, can be exploited to reveal the mass of these planets, in addition to techniques such as radial velocity and transit-timing-variation. Here, using updated radii for Kepler planet hosts from Gaia DR2, I show that the photoevaporation features shift systematically to larger radius for planets around more massive stars (ranging from M-dwarfs to F-dwarfs), corresponding to a nearly linear scaling between planet mass and its host mass. By modelling planet evolution under photo-evaporation, one further deduces that the masses of super-Earths peak narrowly around \$8 M\_\textbackslash backslashoplus (M\_*/M\_\textbackslash backslashodot)\$. Moreover, the composition of their cores is likely terrestrial, and they were initially coated with H/He envelopes a couple percent in mass. Interestingly, the masses of these planets do not appear to depend on the metallicity values of their host stars, while they may depend on the orbital separation weakly, possibly as \$r\^\{1/2\}\$. Taken together, the simplest interpretation of our results is that super-Earths are at the so-called 'thermal mass', where the planet's Hill radius is equal to the vertical scale height of the gas disk.},

Atmosphere evolution depends on the ratio of gain from volatiles to loss from atmosphere stripping fv; for constant bombardment, atmospheres with fv \textbackslash textless 1 are destroyed in finite time, but grow linearly with time for fv \textbackslash textgreater 1. An impact outcome prescription is used to characterise how fv depends on planetesimal impact velocities, size distribution and composition. Planets that are low mass and/or close to the star have atmospheres that deplete in impacts, while high mass and/or distant planets grow secondary atmospheres. Dividing these outcomes is an fv = 1 impact shoreline analogous to Zahnle \& Catling's cosmic shoreline. The impact shoreline's location depends on assumed impacting planetesimal properties, so conclusions for the atmospheric evolution of a planet like Earth with fv {$\approx$} 1 are only as strong as those assumptions. Application to the exoplanet population shows the gap in the planet radius distribution at {$\sim$}1.5R{$\oplus$} is coincident with the impact shoreline, which has a similar dependence on orbital period and stellar mass to the observed gap. Given sufficient bombardment, planets below the gap would be expected to lose their atmospheres, while those above could have atmospheres enhanced in volatiles. The level of atmosphere alteration depends on the total bombardment a planet experiences, and so on the system's (usually unknown) other planets and planetesimals, though massive distant planets would have low accretion efficiency. Habitable zone planets around lower luminosity stars are more susceptible to atmosphere stripping, disfavouring M stars as hosts of life-bearing planets if Earth-like bombardment is conducive to the development of life.},

We repeat our analysis for HAT-P-11, finding a large \$\textbackslash backslashDelta I\$ between its close-in Neptune and cold Jupiter and similar dynamics. \$\textbackslash backslashpi\$ Men and HAT-P-11 are prime examples of systems where dynamically hot outer planets excite their inner planets, with the effects of increasing planet eccentricities, planet-star misalignments, and potentially reducing the transit multiplicity. Formation of such systems likely involves scattering between multiple giant planets or misaligned protoplanetary discs. Future imaging of the faint debris disc in \$\textbackslash backslashpi\$ Men and precise constraints on the stellar spin orientation would provide strong tests for these formation scenarios.},

Our results also allow us to derive the dispersion of planetary orbital inclinations in relationship with stellar effective temperature. Interestingly, it is found to be similar to the well-known trend between obliquity and stellar temperature, indicating that the two trends might have a common origin.},

  abstract = {We investigate whether certain extra-solar multi-planet systems simultaneously follow the scaling and spacing rules of the angular-momentum-deficit model. The masses and semi-major axes of exoplanets in ten multi-planet systems are considered. It is found that GJ 667C, HD 215152, HD 40307, and Kepler-79 systems are currently close to configurations of the angular-momentum-deficit model. In a gas-poor scenario, GJ 3293, HD 141399, and HD 34445 systems are those which had a configuration of the angular-momentum-deficit model in the past and get scattered away due to post gaseous effects. In addition, no matter in gas-free or gas-poor scenario, 55 Cnc, GJ 876, and WASP-47 systems do not follow the angular-momentum-deficit model. Therefore, our results reveal important formation histories of these multi-planet systems.},

  abstract = {The Galilean satellites Io, Europa, and Ganymede interact through several stable orbital resonances where {$\lambda$}1 - 2{$\lambda$}2 + \$\o mega\$1 = 0, {$\lambda$}1 - 2{$\lambda$}2 + \$\o mega\$2 = 180\textdegree, {$\lambda$}2 - 2{$\lambda$}3 + \$\o mega\$2 = 0 and {$\lambda$}1 - 3{$\lambda$}2 + 2{$\lambda$}3 = 180\textdegree, with {$\lambda$}i being the mean longitude of the ith satellite and \$\o mega\$i the longitude of the pericenter. The last relation involving all three bodies is known as the Laplace relation. A theory of origin and subsequent evolution of these resonances outlined earlier (C. F. Yoder, 1979b, Nature 279, 747-770) is described in detail. From an initially quasi-random distribution of the orbits the resonances are assembled through differential tidal expansion of the orbits. Io is driven out most rapidly and the first two resonance variables above are captured into libration about 0 and 180\textdegree{} respectively with unit probability. The orbits of Io and Europa expand together maintaining the 2:1 orbital commensurability and Europa's mean angular velocity approaches a value which is twice that of Ganymede. The third resonance variable and simultaneously the Laplace angle are captured into libration with probability {$\sim$}0.9. The tidal dissipation in Io is vital for the rapid damping of the libration amplitudes and for the establishment of a quasi-stationary orbital configuration. Here the eccentricity of Io's orbit is determined by a balance between the effects of tidal dissipation in Io and that in Jupiter, and its measured value leads to the relation k1f\{hook\}1/Q1 {$\approx$} 900kJ/QJ with the k's being Love numbers, the Q's dissipation factors, and f a factor to account for a molten core in Io. This relation and an upper bound on Q1 deduced from Io's observed thermal activity establishes the bounds 6 \texttimes{} 104 \textbackslash textless QJ \textbackslash textless 2 \texttimes{} 106, where the lower bound follows from the limited expansion of the satellite orbits. The damping time for the Laplace libration and therefore a minimum lifetime of the resonance is 1600 QJ years. Passage of the system through nearby three-body resonances excites free eccentricities. The remnant free eccentricity of Europa leads to the relation Q2/f\{hook\}2 \{greater-than or approximate\} 2 \texttimes{} 10-4 QJ for rigidity {$\mu$}2 = 5 \texttimes{} 1011 dynes/cm2. Probable capture into any of several stable 3:1 two-body resonances implies that the ratio of the orbital mean motions of any adjacent pair of satellites was never this large. A generalized Hamiltonian theory of the resonances in which third-order terms in eccentricity are retained is developed to evaluate the hypothesis that the resonances were of primordial origin. The Laplace relation is unstable for values of Io's eccentricity e1 \textbackslash textgreater 0.012 showing that the theory which retains only the linear terms in e1 is not valid for values of e1 larger than about twice the current value. Processes by which the resonances can be established at the time of satellite formation are undefined, but even if primordial formation is conjectured, the bounds established above for QJ cannot be relaxed. Electromagnetic torques on Io are also not sufficient to relax the bounds on QJ. Some ideas on processes for the dissipation of ideal energy in Jupiter yield values of QJ within the dynamical bounds, but no theory has produced a QJ small enough to be compatible with the measurements of heat flow from Io given the above relation between Q1 and QJ. Tentative observational bounds on the secular acceleration of Io's mean motion are also shown not to be consistent with such low values of QJ. Io's heat flow may therefore be episodic. QJ may actually be determined from improved analysis of 300 years of eclipse data. \textcopyright{} 1981.},

This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. We apply the method to announced Kepler planet candidates that transit solar-type stars. The Kepler team's estimates of the detection efficiency are used and are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. The PLDF is fit to a joint power law in planet radius, down to 0.5 R {$\oplus$}, and orbital period, up to 50days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is {$\sim$}0.7-1.4, where the range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7days and between large and small radii at 3 R {$\oplus$}. The size distribution changes appreciably between these four samples, revealing a relative deficit of {$\sim$}3 R{$\oplus$} planets at the shortest periods. This deficit is suggestive of preferential evaporation and sublimation of Neptune- and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational support of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and would allow refinement of these theories. \textcopyright{} 2011.

  abstract = {Nitrogen is a biosignature gas that cannot be maintained in its Earth-like ratio with CO\$\_2\$ under abiotic conditions. It has also proven to be notoriously hard to detect at optical and infrared wavelengths. Fortunately, the ultraviolet region, which has only recently started being explored for terrestrial exoplanets, may provide new opportunities to characterise exoplanetary atmospheric nitrogen. In this work, the future prospects for detecting atomic nitrogen absorption lines in the transmission spectrum of an Earth-like planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star with LUVOIR are explored. Using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis code Cloudy, we produce a far-ultraviolet atomic transmission spectrum for an Earth-Sun-like system, and identify several nitrogen features, including both N I and N II lines. We calculate the number of transits required for 1\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ and 3\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ detections of the planetary N\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$sc i\} \$\textbackslash backslashlambda1200\$ triplet signal with the G120M grating of the LUMOS spectrograph designed for LUVOIR, as a function of distance to the system and stellar ultraviolet emission. The minimum number of transit observations necessary for 1\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ and 3\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ detections of atomic N are 188 and 1685, respectively, for a system located at a distance of one pc with 100 times the Solar ultraviolet flux. Given that the orbital period of an Earth-Sun system is one year, it is not feasible to detect atomic N in the transmission spectrum for these systems. Future studies in this direction should therefore focus on Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarfs.},

The observatories and instruments that will be able to perform transmission spectroscopy of exo-Earths are beginning to be planned, and characterizing the transmission spectrum of Earth is vital to ensuring that key spectral features (e.g., ozone, or O3) are appropriately captured in mission concept studies. O3 is photochemically produced from O2, a product of the dominant metabolism on Earth today, and it will be sought in future observations as critical evidence for life on exoplanets. Ground-based observations of lunar eclipses have provided the Earth's transmission spectrum at optical and near-IR wavelengths, but the strongest O3 signatures are in the near-UV. We describe the observations and methods used to extract a transmission spectrum from Hubble lunar eclipse spectra, and identify spectral features of O3 and Rayleigh scattering in the 3000-5500 \AA{} region in Earth's transmission spectrum by comparing to Earth models that include refraction effects in the terrestrial atmosphere during a lunar eclipse. Our near-UV spectra are featureless, a consequence of missing the narrow time span during the eclipse when near-UV sunlight is not completely attenuated through Earth's atmosphere due to extremely strong O3 absorption and when sunlight is transmitted to the lunar surface at altitudes where it passes through the O3 layer rather than above it.},

We aim to better characterize the formation process of M dwarf planets to fill this gap and aid in the interpretation of TESS results. We use ten sets of N-body planet formation simulations that vary in whether a gas disc is present, initial range of embryo semimajor axes, and initial solid surface density profile. Each simulation begins with 147 equal-mass embryos around a 0.2 solar mass star and runs for 100 Myr. We find that planets form rapidly, with most collisions occurring within the first 1 Myr. The presence of a gas disc reduces the final number of planets relative to a gas-free environment and causes planets to migrate inward. We find that roughly a quarter of planetary systems experience their final giant impact inside the gas disc, suggesting that some super-Earths may be able to reaccrete an extended gaseous envelope after their final giant impact, though these may be affected by additional processes such as photoevaporation. In addition, we find that the final distribution of planets does not retain a memory of the slope of the initial surface density profile, regardless of whether or not a gas disc is present. Thus, our results suggest that present-day observations are unlikely to provide sufficient information to accurately reverse-engineer the initial distribution of solids.},

Only a few modifications are required for the computation and the computational effort is similar. Our approach brings together several related methods that can be found in the literature, viz. the date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, the floating-mean periodogram, and the "spectral significance" estimator used in the SigSpec program, for which we point out some equivalences.

Aims: We develop least-squares fitting algorithms to derive the RVs and additional spectral diagnostics implemented in the SpEctrum Radial Velocity Analyser (SERVAL), a publicly available python code. Methods: We measured the RVs using high signal-to-noise templates created by coadding all available spectra of each star.We define the chromatic index as the RV gradient as a function of wavelength with the RVs measured in the echelle orders. Additionally, we computed the differential line width by correlating the fit residuals with the second derivative of the template to track variations in the stellar line width. Results: Using HARPS data, our SERVAL code achieves a RV precision at the level of 1m/s. Applying the chromatic index to CARMENES data of the active star YZ CMi, we identify apparent RV variations induced by stellar activity. The differential line width is found to be an alternative indicator to the commonly used full width half maximum. Conclusions: We find that at the red optical wavelengths (700\textendash 900 nm) obtained by the visual channel of CARMENES, the chromatic index is an excellent tool to investigate stellar active regions and to identify and perhaps even correct for activity-induced RV variations.},

  abstract = {Context. Teegarden's Star is the brightest and one of the nearest ultra-cool dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. For its late spectral type (M7.0 V), the star shows relatively little activity and is a prime target for near-infrared radial velocity surveys such as CARMENES. Aims. As part of the CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs, we obtained more than 200 radial-velocity measurements of Teegarden's Star and analysed them for planetary signals. Methods. We find periodic variability in the radial velocities of Teegarden's Star. We also studied photometric measurements to rule out stellar brightness variations mimicking planetary signals. Results. We find evidence for two planet candidates, each with 1.1 M {$\oplus$} minimum mass, orbiting at periods of 4.91 and 11.4 d, respectively. No evidence for planetary transits could be found in archival and follow-up photometry. Small photometric variability is suggestive of slow rotation and old age. Conclusions. The two planets are among the lowest-mass planets discovered so far, and they are the first Earth-mass planets around an ultra-cool dwarf for which the masses have been determined using radial velocities.},

  abstract = {The radii and orbital periods of 4,000+ confirmed/candidate exoplanets have been precisely measured by the Kepler mission. The radii show a bimodal distribution, with two peaks corresponding to smaller planets (likely rocky) and larger intermediate-size planets, respectively. While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H2\textendash He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H2O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in the mass range of 10\textendash 15 M, if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have radii of 2.5 R, which exactly match the second peak of the exoplanet radius bimodal distribution. Any planet in the 2-to 4-R range requires a gas envelope of at most a few mass percentage points, regardless of the core composition. To resolve the ambiguity of internal compositions, we use a growth model and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that many intermediate-size planets are ``water worlds''.},

Traditionally, constraints on the gas mass distribution are derived from observations of the dust emission from disks 2,3, but this approach suffers from large uncertainties in dust opacity and gas-to-dust ratio 2. On the other hand, previous observations of gas tracers only probe surface layers above the bulk mass reservoir 4. Here we present the first partially spatially resolved observations of the 13 C 18 O J = 3-2 line emission in the closest protoplanetary disk, TW Hydrae, a gas tracer that probes the bulk mass distribution. Combining it with the C 18 O J = 3-2 emission and the previously detected HD J = 1-0 flux, we directly constrain the mid-plane temperature and optical depths of gas and dust emission. We report a gas mass distribution with radius, R, of 13\^a '5+8\texttimes (R/20.5au)\^a '0.9\^a '0.3+0.4 g cm \^a '2 in the expected formation zone of gas and ice giants (5-21 au). We find that the mass ratio of total gas to millimetre-sized dust is 140 in this region, suggesting that at least 2.4M \^a\v{S} \textbullet{} of dust aggregates have grown to centimetre sizes (and perhaps much larger). The radial distribution of gas mass is consistent with a self-similar viscous disk profile but much flatter than the posterior extrapolation of mass distribution in our own and extrasolar planetary systems.},

  abstract = {Super Earths and mini Neptunes likely have a wide range of atmospheric compositions, ranging from low-molecular mass atmospheres of H2 to higher molecular atmospheres of water, CO2, N2, or other species. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets, using an idealized 3D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk composition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent variables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular weight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the equatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the "jet core" region, where the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level. The zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also present analytical theories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the underlying dynamical mechanisms. Those trends might be used to indirectly determine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere.},

Although the formation of circumstellar disks can be a natural result of the conservation of angular momentum in the parent cloud, theoretical studies instead show disk formation to be difficult from dense molecular cores magnetized to a realistic level, owing to efficient magnetic braking that transports a large fraction of the angular momentum away from the circumstellar region. We review recent progress in the formation and early evolution of disks around young stellar objects of both low-mass and high-mass, with an emphasis on mechanisms that may bridge the gap between observation and theory, including non-ideal MHD effects and asymmetric perturbations in the collapsing core (e.g., magnetic field misalignment and turbulence). We also address the associated processes of outflow launching and the formation of multiple systems, and discuss possible implications in properties of protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {The distribution of heavy elements is anomalously low in the asteroid main belt region compared with elsewhere in the solar system. Observational surveys also indicate a deficit in the number of small (\$ \textbackslash backslashle 50\${$\sim$}km size) asteroids that is two orders of magnitude lower than what is expected from the single power-law distribution that results from a collisional coagulation and fragmentation equilibrium. Here, we consider the possibility that a major fraction of the original asteroid population may have been cleared out by Jupiter's secular resonance, as it swept through the main asteroid belt during the depletion of the solar nebula. This effect leads to the excitation of the asteroids' orbital eccentricities. Concurrently, hydrodynamic drag and planet-disk tidal interaction effectively damp the eccentricities of sub-100 km-size and of super-lunar-size planetesimals, respectively. These combined effects lead to the asteroids' orbital decay and clearing from the present-day main belt region (\$\textbackslash backslashsim 2.1-3.3\${$\sim$}AU). The intermediate-size (50 to several hundreds of kilometers) planetesimals therefore preferentially remain as main belt asteroids near their birthplaces, with modest asymptotic eccentricities. The smaller asteroids are the fragments of subsequent disruptive collisions at later times as suggested by the present-day asteroid families. This scenario provides a natural explanation for both the observed low surface density and the size distribution of asteroids in the main belt. It also offers an explanation for the confined spatial extent of the terrestrial planet building blocks without the requirement of extensive migration of Jupiter.},

We report the discovery and validation of two planetary systems with ages \$\textbackslash backslashlesssim 300\$ Myr from observations by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. TOI-251 is a 40-320 Myr old G star hosting a 2.74 +0.18/-0.18 REarth mini-Neptune with a 4.94 day period. TOI-942 is a 20-160 Myr old K star hosting a system of inflated Neptune-sized planets, with TOI-942b orbiting with a period of 4.32 days, with a radius of 4.81 +0.20/-0.20 REarth, and TOI-942c orbiting in a period of 10.16 days with a radius of 5.79 +0.19/-0.18 REarth. Though we cannot place either host star into a known stellar association or cluster, we can estimate their ages via their photometric and spectroscopic properties. Both stars exhibit significant photometric variability due to spot modulation, with measured rotation periods of \$\textbackslash backslashsim 3.5\$ days. These stars also exhibit significant chromospheric activity, with age estimates from the chromospheric calcium emission lines and X-ray fluxes matching that estimated from gyrochronology. Both stars also exhibit significant lithium absorption, similar in equivalent width to well-characterized young cluster members. TESS has the potential to deliver a population of young planet-bearing field stars, contributing significantly to tracing the properties of planets as a function of their age.},

  abstract = {We constrain the intrinsic architecture of Kepler planetary systems by modeling the observed multiplicities of the transiting planets (tranets) and their transit timing variations (TTVs). We robustly determine that the fraction of Sun-like stars with Kepler-like planets, \$\textbackslash backslasheta\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm Kepler\}\$, is \$30\textbackslash backslashpm3\textbackslash backslash\%\$. Here Kepler-like planets are planets that have radii \$R\_\{\textbackslash backslashrm p\} \textbackslash backslashgtrsim R\_\textbackslash backslashoplus\$ and orbital periods \$P\textbackslash textless400\${$\sim$}days. Our result thus significantly revises previous claims that more than 50\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% of Sun-like stars have such planets. Combining with the average number of Kepler planets per star (\$\textbackslash backslashsim0.9\$), we obtain that on average each planetary system has \$3.0\textbackslash backslashpm0.3\$ planets within 400 days. We also find that the dispersion in orbital inclinations of planets within a given planetary system, \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\_\{i,k\}\$, is a steep function of its number of planets, \$k\$. This can be parameterized as \$\textbackslash backslashsigma\_\{i,k\}\textbackslash backslashpropto k\^\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ and we find that \$-4\textbackslash textless\textbackslash backslashalpha\textbackslash textless-2\$ at 2-\$\textbackslash backslashsigma\$ level. Such a distribution well describes the observed multiplicities of both tranets and TTVs with no excess of single tranets. Therefore we do not find evidence supporting the so-called "Kepler dichotomy." Together with a previous study on orbital eccentricities, we now have a consistent picture: the fewer planets in a system, the hotter it is dynamically. We discuss briefly possible scenarios that lead to such a trend. Despite our Solar system not belonging to the Kepler club, it is interesting to notice that the Solar system also has three planets within 400 days and that the inclination dispersion is similar to Kepler systems of the same multiplicity.},

We find that cold Jupiters appear three times more often around hosts of super Earths than they do around field stars. Given the prevalence of the super Earth systems, their cold Jupiters can account for nearly all cold Jupiters. In other words, cold Jupiters are almost certainly (\$\textbackslash backslashsim90\textbackslash backslash\%\$) companied by super Earths. A few corollaries follow: (1) around metal-rich ([Fe/H]\$\textbackslash textgreater0.1\$) stars, the fraction of super Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to \$60\textbackslash backslash\%\$ or higher; (2) the inner architecture can be strongly impacted by the outer giant and we report some observational evidence for this; (3) planetary systems like our own, with cold Jupiters but no super Earths, should be rare (\$\textbackslash backslashsim1\textbackslash backslash\%\$). The strong correlation between super Earths and cold Jupiters establish that super Earths and cold Jupiters do not compete for solid material, rather, they share similar origins, with the cold Jupiter formation requiring a somewhat more stringent condition. Lastly, we propose a few immediate observational tests of our results, using ground-based RV observations and ongoing/planned space missions.},

  abstract = {ALMA surveys have suggested that the dust in Class II disks may not be enough to explain the averaged solid mass in exoplanets. This suggestion stems from an assumption that the mm continuum emission is optically thin, which seems to be supported by recent DSHARP observations where the measured optical depths of spatially resolved disks are mostly less than one. However, we point out that dust scattering can considerably reduce the emission from an optically thick region. If that scattering is ignored, the optical depth will be considerably underestimated. An optically thick disk with scattering can be misidentified as an optically thin disk. Dust scattering in more inclined disks can reduce the intensity even further, making the disk look even fainter. The measured optical depth of {$\sim$}0.6 in several DSHARP disks can be naturally explained by optically thick dust with an albedo of {$\sim$}0.9 at 1.25 mm. Using the DSHARP opacity, this albedo corresponds to a dust population with the maximum grain size (\$s\_\{max\}\$) of 0.1-1 mm. For optically thick scattering disks, the measured spectral index \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ can be either larger or smaller than 2 depending on if the dust albedo increases or decreases with wavelength. Using the DSHARP opacity, \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\textbackslash textless2\$ corresponds to \$s\_\{max\}\$ of 0.03-0.3 mm. Furthermore, when the disk changes from optically thick to optically thin, \$\textbackslash backslashalpha\$ should change suddenly. We describe how this optical thick scattering scenario could explain the observed scaling between submm continuum sizes and luminosities, and might help ease the tension between the dust size constraints from polarization and dust continuum measurements. We suggest that longer wavelength observations (e.g. ngVLA or SKA) are desired to probe the dust mass in disks. When the disk is optically thick, the measured 1) emssion reduction and 2) the spectral index provide stringent constraints on the dust properties.},

Recent remote sensing observations suggest that (1) the crust on the farside highlands consists of two layers: a primary anorthositic layer with thickness of {$\sim$}30-50 km and on top a more mafic-rich layer {$\sim$}10 km thick and (2) the nearside exhibits a large area of low-Ca pyroxene that has been interpreted to have an impact origin. These observations support the idea that the lunar nearside-farside asymmetries may be the result of a giant impact. Here using quantitative numerical modeling, we test the hypothesis that a giant impact on the early Moon can explain the striking differences in elevation, crustal thickness, and composition between the nearside and farside of the Moon. We find that a large impactor, impacting the current nearside with a low velocity, can form a mega-basin and reproduce the characteristics of the crustal asymmetry and structures comparable to those observed on the current Moon, including the nearside lowlands and the farside's mafic-rich layer on top of a primordial anorthositic crust. Our model shows that the excavated deep-seated KREEP (potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus) material, deposited close to the basin rim, slumps back into the basin and covers the entire basin floor; subsequent large impacts can transport the shallow KREEP material to the surface, resulting in its observed distribution. In addition, our model suggests that prior to the asymmetry-forming impact, the Moon may have had an 182W anomaly compared to the immediate post-giant impact Earth's mantle, as predicted if the Moon was created through a giant collision with the proto-Earth.},

  abstract = {Recent studies claimed that planets around the same star have similar sizes and masses and regular spacings, and that planet pairs usually show ordered sizes such that the outer planet is usually the larger one. Here I show that these patterns can be largely explained by detection biases. The Kepler planet detections are set by the transit signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For different stellar properties and orbital period values, the same S/N corresponds to different planetary sizes. This variation in the detection threshold naturally leads to apparent correlations in planet sizes and the observed size ordering. The apparently correlated spacings, measured in period ratios, between adjacent planet pairs in systems with at least three detected planets are partially due to the arbitrary upper limit that the earlier study imposed on the period ratio, and partially due to the varying stability threshold for different planets. After these detection biases are taken into account, we do not find strong evidence for the so-called ``intra-system uniformity'' or the size ordering effect. Instead, the physical properties of Kepler planets are largely independent of the properties of their siblings and the parent star. It is likely that the dynamical evolution has erased the memory of Kepler planets about their initial formation conditions. In other words, it will be difficult to infer the initial conditions from the observed properties and the architecture of Kepler planets.},

  abstract = {We investigate the role that planet detection order plays in the Kepler planet detection pipeline. The Kepler pipeline typically detects planets in order of descending signal strength (MES). We find that the detectability of transits experiences an additional 5.5 per cent and 15.9 per cent efficiency loss, for periods \textbackslash textless200 days and \textbackslash textgreater200 days respectively, when detected after the strongest signal transit in a multiple-planet system. We provide a method for determining the transit probability for multiple-planet systems by marginalizing over the empirical Kepler dataset. Furthermore, because detection efficiency appears to be a function of detection order, we discuss the sorting statistics that affect the radius and period distributions of each detection order. Our occurrence rate dataset includes radius measurement updates from the California Kepler Survey (CKS), Gaia DR2, and asteroseismology. Our population model is consistent with the results of Burke et al. (2015), but now includes an improved estimate of the multiplicity distribution. From our obtained model parameters, we find that only 4.0 {$\pm$} 4.6 per cent of solar-like GK dwarfs harbour one planet. This excess is smaller than prior studies and can be well modelled with a modified Poisson distribution, suggesting that the Kepler Dichotomy can be accounted for by including the effects of multiplicity on detection efficiency. Using our modified Poisson model, we expect the average number of planets is 5.86 {$\pm$} 0.18 planets per GK dwarf within the radius and period parameter space of Kepler.},

  abstract = {Using our K2 Campaign 5 fully automated planet detection data set (43 planets), which has corresponding measures of completeness and reliability, we infer an underlying planet population model for the FGK dwarfs sample (9,257 stars). Implementing a broken power-law for both the period and radius distribution, we find an overall planet occurrence of \$1.00\^\{+1.07\}\_\{-0.51\}\$ planets per star within a period range of 0.5-38 days. Making similar cuts and running a comparable analysis on the Kepler sample (2,318 planets; 94,222 stars), we find an overall occurrence of \$1.10\textbackslash backslashpm0.05\$ planets per star. Since the Campaign 5 field is nearly 120 angular degrees away from the Kepler field, this occurrence similarity offers evidence that the Kepler sample may provide a good baseline for Galactic inferences. Furthermore, the Kepler stellar sample is metal-rich compared to the K2 Campaign 5 sample, thus a finding of occurrence parity may reduce the role of metallicity in planet formation. However, a weak (\$1.5\textbackslash backslashsigma\$) difference, in agreement with metal-driven formation, is found when assuming the Kepler model power-laws for the K2 Campaign 5 sample and optimizing only the planet occurrence factor. This weak trend indicates further investigation of metallicity dependent occurrence is warranted once a larger sample of uniformly vetted K2 planet candidates are made available.},

Within the range of our search, we find 8 previously undetected candidates with the remaining 66 candidates overlapping 51\% of the Kruse et al. study that manually vet Campaign 5 candidates. In order to vet our potential transit signals, we introduce the Exoplanet Detection Identification Vetter (EDI-Vetter), which is a fully automated program able to determine if a transit signal should be labeled as a false positive or a planet candidate. This automation allows us to create a statistically uniform catalog, ideal for planet occurrence rate measurements. When tested, the vetting software is able to ensure our sample is 94.2\% reliable against systematic false positives. Additionally, we inject artificial transits at the light-curve-level of the raw K2 data and find the maximum completeness of our pipeline is 70\% before vetting and 60\% after vetting. For convenience of future occurrence rate studies, we include measurements of stellar noise (CDPP) and the three-transit window function for each target. This study is part of a larger survey of the K2 data set and the methodology which will be applied to the entirety of the K2 data set.},

We tested the solid accretion rate efficiency on planetary cores of different masses embedded in their birth disk, by means of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics, where we followed the evolution of a swarm of embedded solids of different sizes. We found that using a realistic equation of state and radiative cooling, the disk at 5 au is able to cool efficiently and reduce its aspect ratio. As a result, the pebble isolation mass is reached before the core grows to 10 Earth masses, stopping efficiently the pebble flux and creating a transition disk. Moreover, the reduced isolation mass halts the solid accretion before the core reaches the critical mass, leading to a barrier to giant planet formation, and it explains the large abundance of super-Earth planets in the observed population.},

They cover the range 2.10 \textbackslash textless log T(K) \textbackslash textless 7.06 and 4 \textbackslash textless log P (dyn cm -2) \textbackslash textless 19 and include new physical treatments of partial dissociation and ionization caused by both pressure and temperature effects. The hydrogen EOS is based on a careful study of nonideal interactions. In the case of helium, the principal features of the EOS physics are retained in a simplified model. The calculation is based on the free energy minimization method, and a detailed account of the physical model has been published elsewhere. Mixtures of hydrogen and helium are obtained with the additive volume rule and an additional ideal entropy-of-mixing term. In this paper, we present extensive tabular results for both the H and He EOS, together with a critical analysis. Part of this analysis is based on a comparison with other EOS commonly used in astrophysics. Both EOS everywhere satisfy the requirements of thermal and mechanical stability and are thermodynamically consistent over most of the phase diagram.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF EQUATIONS OF STATE The richness of stellar phenomena exposed by modem ob-servational techniques calls for a quantitative understanding of more subtle, " second-order " effects in stellar structure and evolution. Examples of phenomena requiring accurate model-ing of the underlying physics include the solar oscillation spec-trum, the solar neutrino problem, stellar pulsations, and the abundances of elements in the photospheres of white dwarfs. Recent progress in infrared technology, together with the ad-vent of new space observatories and of large ground-based telescopes, is fostering a substantially increased interest in the-oretical studies of very low mass stars and of substellar brown dwarfs. Modeling these objects demands an understanding of the properties of matter under more extreme conditions than found in normal stars. Many astrophysical problems require knowledge of the properties of matter at or near thermodynamic equilibrium. The thermodynamic properties of a fluid are characterized by the equation of state (EOS), which uniquely determines the pressure and all other thermodynamic quantities as functions of density and temperature, and which directly enters the equations of stellar evolution. The pressure P\{p, T) and the entropy S\{p, T) appear explicitly in these equations and dic-tate the mechanical and thermal equilibria of the star, respec-tively.
